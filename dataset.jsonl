journey of self-discovery and reconnecting with one's roots. The act of walking on water can be seen as a metaphor for defying expectations and limitations, similar to how Jesus Christ defied the laws of nature.

The lyrics also touch on themes of forgiveness, redemption, and reclaiming one's power and agency. The list of ships and historical names towards the end of the song could represent a reclaiming of history and a recognition of the atrocities of the past.\n\nOverall, the lyrics seem to explore themes of identity, history, resilience, and the interconnectedness of humanity and nature.

The main character in the song is described as being trapped in a box, both physically and metaphorically. He is constantly watching and listening to what others in their respective boxes do and say, and he follows suit without question or hesitation. This blind imitation of others and the fear of stepping outside of the box represent the idea of conformity and the pressures to fit in with societal norms.\n\nThe metaphor of being chained to the box and swallowing the combination to unlock it can be interpreted as a self-imposed imprisonment, where the character has lost the ability to break free from the constraints that hold them back. The repetition of how the character never lies because they never say anything at all suggests a lack of autonomy and a suppression of one's true voice and identity.\n\nThe mention of buying new clothes to hide scars and building a roof to hide stars could symbolize the character's attempts to cover up their true selves and the beauty within them.

The song explores the idea that patience is key in navigating through challenges and obstacles in life.\n\nThe lyrics suggest that at the beginning of a relationship or endeavor, there is an abundance of patience and eagerness. However, as time goes on and difficulties arise, that patience may turn into waiting, wasting time, and eventually lead to hating or resentment. The artists emphasize the importance of being patient and taking time to truly understand and appreciate the situation before making impulsive decisions.\n\nMetaphorically, the song compares the journey of a relationship or pursuit to driving a car. The artists mention getting sick, getting cold feet, and building up immunity, suggesting that individuals may become numb or desensitized to the challenges they face.

{"tite": "DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO\u2019S TETSUO & YOUTH", "lyrics": "--- After listening to Lupe\u2019s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this analysis by getting into the album\u2019s last portion which ran from the season of Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period; I will get into all that later\n--- The season started with \u201cChopper\u201d and a lot of people are wondering why a song like \"Chopper\" is on the album. Well, you can't just get into a song like \"Deliver\" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why \u201cChopper\" is there. It's a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and the gangstas that live in the trap\n--- Moving onto \u201cDeliver,\u201d like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in \u201cChopper\" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, \"Pizza man don\u2019t come here no more,\u201d it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can\u2019t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn\u2019t come there no more, and this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence that is preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza; this all goes back to \u201cChopper\u201d and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn\u2019t come there no more. This one ties into the next song, \u201cMadonna (And other mothers of the hood),\u201d because the piece-of MAN not being there is referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up without them. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so there are significant chances that he\u2019ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations, which will eventually lead to the mother's concern for her child\u2019s well being\n--- With all the information thus far, I think it\u2019s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words is another name for Virgin Mary, who was the mother of Jesus Christ who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus\u2019s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom\u2019s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus\u2019s crucifixion\n--- The next song, \u201cThe Adoration of the Magi,\u201d contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game, and the next song which he appears in, \u201cThey.Resurrect.Over.New.\" This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who are not familiar with The Game's background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, \u201cPut You On Game,\u201d which was rapped primarily from The Game's perspective with lyrics from that song that go, \"I\u2019m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.\u201d This song, \u201cAdoration of the Magi\u201d continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist\u2019s albums that had \nbabies on the covers (Ready to Die, Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.)\n to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering. That\u2019s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it). Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn\u2019t know it; this is why she is wanted by the game, or \u201cadored by the magi.\u201d\n--- Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song\n--- Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it\u2019s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, \u201cWhat if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi?\u201d Here\u2019s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, \"Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus).\" If we look at the phrase from a hood perspective, he is saying, \u201cMadonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstas, drug dealers, killers).\u201d\n--- Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth, then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth\u2019s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like \u201cwe should be closer\u201d and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, \u201cTrapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.\u201d And the only way to get past The Game is to \u201cProceed to the next level\u201d which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, or the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of \nproceeding to the next level\n is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul\u2019s last line, \u201cUnloose the Noose.\u201d That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes\n--- That is about it for the story, but there is still the concept of \nthe seasons\n that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? \nThat was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time\n. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on \nThe Streets\n again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them\n--- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It\u2019s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks\n--- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. \nIf this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece.\n This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. \nLupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever.\n It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, \nthe cycle will never end\n\n---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season\u2019s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS\n\nP.S. \nIf you listen to the album in reverse, it's basically a documentary of Lupe's life thus far and a message for what's to come\n\n", "summary": "The analysis of Lupe Fiasco's album, Tetsuo & Youth, presents a deep exploration of themes such as youth, violence, the impact of absent father figures, and the cycle of poverty and crime in the hood.

The concept of \"Proceed to the next level\" symbolizes breaking away from negative influences and destructive cycles to create a better future for oneself and the community. \n\nThe mention of video game references throughout the album ties into the idea of the Game as a metaphor for the challenges and temptations faced by the youth in the hood.

{"tite": "Don\u2019t Mess up the Children (Interlude)", "lyrics": "[Interlude: Dr. Nolan Shaw]\nAdults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, \nGod insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up.\n In other words, \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n. African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying \"thank you\" or \"no thank you\" and other forms of common courtesy. \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n\n", "summary": "The interlude by Dr. Nolan Shaw highlights the importance of adults taking responsibility for teaching and guiding children, particularly in African American communities.

The mention of \"cutting back on the lies\" at the end suggests a turning point or realization of the need to let go of illusions and embrace a more authentic sense of self."}

Despite facing obstacles and criticism from others, he continues to push forward and pursue his passion. Skateboarding is portrayed as a form of self-expression and defiance against societal norms. \n\nThe chorus emphasizes the act of kicking, pushing, and coasting on a skateboard as a metaphor for navigating through life's challenges and finding one's own path. The skateboard serves as a symbol of freedom, individuality, and resilience. \n\nAdditionally, the lyrics also touch on themes of identity, belonging, and the struggle for acceptance. Pharrell's verse delves into his own personal experiences as a Black skater and the complexities of navigating different cultural identities. \n\nOverall, \"Kick, Push\" is a celebration of the skateboarding subculture and a reflection on the power of pursuing one's passions, staying true to oneself, and overcoming obstacles in the pursuit of personal goals and dreams."}
{"tite": "Philosophy Sunday (Free Speech)", "lyrics": "[Free Speech Tweets: Lupe Fiasco and Twitter Followers]\n[LP] \nToday's idea for ponder comes from Julian Assange and his intriguing assessment of the impotence of western free speech via economic forces\n\n[LP] He says:\n\n\"The west has fiscalised its basic power relationships through a web of contracts, loans, shareholdings, bank holdings and so on.\"\n[LP] \"In such an environment it's easy 4 speech 2be \"free\" becuz a change in political will rarely leads 2any change in these basic instruments.\"\n[LP] \"Western speech, as something that rarely has any effect on power, is, like badgers and birds, free.\"\n[LP] \"In states like China, there is pervasive censorship, because speech still has power and power is scared of it.\"\n[LP] \"We should always look at censorship as an economic signal that reveals the potential power of speech in that jurisdiction.\"\n\nJulian Assange\n[LP] The core of what he is saying is that the proliferation of free speech inversely represents the lack of effect it has on power structures.\n[LP] The more the speech is \"free\" the less powerful it really is. It is a very radical angle. Any takers?\n\n#PhilosophySunday\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Julian Assange proved in a way that speech is not free.. Not when it comes to the west. Here your speech is mediated... and controlled by those in power. Speech is not truly free when it is corralled under the terms of who it's directed at\n[TW] @LupeFiasco I think Assange is absolutely correct. Speech is very feared, mostly when it's unpopular and free.\n[LP] But what he is inferring is that power does NOT in fact fear \"free\" speech at all. It is \"free\" becuz it is not feared. @CalebFnCool\n[TW] @LupeFiasco occupy wall street was a powerful and dangerous free speech movement that was aimed towards eliminating US capitalism #PS\n[LP] Actually u could say the \"danger\" of OWS was mitigated becuz it was built on the powerless premise of western free speech @kamilahvictoria\n\n[TW] Salman Rushdie is more impactful in India because he is persecuted for his writings. It ironically brings exposure @LupeFiasco #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco i dont think the fact that it's free makes it less powerful, it's the intent and lack of meaning or thought behind it #ps\n[LP] Look at this way. How much to do u truly cherish something that was given to u for free as opposed to a thing u had to pay $$$ for? @cbuddz\n[TW] .@LupeFiasco but the attempt to stifle peaceful protests like Occupy shows the US government is scared of free speech #PS\n[LP] I don't think so. I think it was the OWS aesthetic that was unpleasant to the power structure. Inconvenient but no threat @JordanRaeLake\n[TW] @LupeFiasco can you use his view on free speech when he worked to leak information?\n[LP] I think the reaction to the leaks by the US is because it threatened external relations NOT the internal Western status quos @mullady21\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Free speech, rarely appreciated until it's taken away, most of our generation raised in the U.S. has never experienced this. #PS\n[LP] Does this \"taking away\" lead to a sort of resentment or anger that could possibly empower speech overall? @MIKJAGGA\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Part of this thinking is also derived from the idea that the western world is as good as it gets and can ever be #PS\n[LP] Very interesting @TravisGBTBB\n[TW] @LupeFiasco one could say that America has more of a stranglehold on their people than China does. #PS #Solzhenitsyn\n[LP] Ah the Spector of democratic tyranny... @EvansBranagh\n[TW] @LupeFiasco so our goal is to have a opinion worth silencing? Because being allowed means you and your word has no meaning.\n[LP] It may mean that silence is more powerful that words. As it removes a barometer for the power structure to \"test\" society @AvaryF\n[TW] @AvaryF @lupefiasco I feel even with an opinion worth silencing we're still somehow overshadowed by ignorance\n[LP] \"What they do not know will hurt them\" so to speak Or Biggies line \"Bad Boys move in silence.\" Limit the information accessible @AvaryF\n[TW] @LupeFiasco for example the OWS movement would be incredibly strong now had the power system not given the movement media attention #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco I would argue that Information overload functions as a form of censorship because it is almost impossible to find the truth anyway\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco speech if everyone had a Bugatti and flaunts it, it goes down in value. speech becomes an materialistic thought in this essence\n[LP] Speech defined as a being a material is very interesting. #ps #twittergold right there @xygoma_\n[TW] @LupeFiasco a politician's speech is not seen as 'powerless'. If people organised themselves better & then spoke, neither would theirs. #PS\n[LP] It can b argued tht a politicians freespeech is the least powerful of all Think of the ambiguity of the \"campaign promise\" @_MudassarRashid\n[LP] And that's #PhilosophySunday for this week. Thanks 2 everyone who chimed in! Shout 2 yall who struck #twittergold . See y'all next week #ps\n\n", "summary": "The tweets from Lupe Fiasco and his Twitter followers delve into the concept of free speech and its effectiveness in the Western world. Julian Assange's idea that free speech in the West is actually not feared by those in power because it does not lead to any significant change in power structures is a thought-provoking one. The comparison to China, where censorship is pervasive because speech still holds power, highlights the contrast in how speech is viewed and controlled in different societies.\n\nThe discussion also touches on the impact of free speech movements like Occupy Wall Street and the perception of power dynamics in relation to speech. There is a debate on whether speech becomes less powerful when it is \"free\" and easily accessible, as opposed to when it is restricted or persecuted. The idea of resentment and anger empowering speech when it is taken away is also explored, as well as the role of information overload in shaping our understanding of truth.\n\nOverall, the tweets reflect a nuanced exploration of the complexities surrounding free speech, power structures, and the impact of speech in society. The comparison between the Western world and countries like China offers valuable insights into the different ways in which speech is valued and controlled."}

In the first verse, Lupe talks about realizing the need for change and growth, urging the listener to open up their eyes and imagine a different reality. He emphasizes the importance of expanding one's horizons through creativity, rather than focusing on destructive behaviors like drug dealing and violence.\n\nThe hook sung by Gorillaz questions whether humanity has lost its way, wondering if we are truly the last living souls who still possess the capacity to love and understand the world around us. The imagery of being \"the last living souls\" suggests a sense of isolation and alienation in a world that may have lost touch with its deeper emotions and connections.\n\nIn the second verse, Lupe references his mixtape \"Fahrenheit 1/15\" and celebrates the unity and camaraderie of the FNF (First and Fifteenth) army. He encourages listeners to enjoy themselves responsibly, showing care for others and practicing gratitude for the good in their lives.\n\nOverall, these lyrics challenge listeners to reflect on their actions, values, and relationships, urging them to strive for a more conscious and compassionate way of living.

The protagonist, Teriyaki Joe, is a detective navigating this strange world and interacting with different characters, such as the devil-like figure named 11.\n\nSome major themes and metaphors that can be inferred from these lyrics include:\n\n1. Class divide and social hierarchy: The contrast between the luxurious image of champagne and classical music, and the grimy reality of the cab suggests a divide between the elite and the lower class. This theme is further reinforced by the mention of Border patrol and the concept of \"upstairs\" and \"downstairs.\"\n\n2. Technology and surveillance: The mention of ID tags, disinfection nozzles, and sensory disconnect allude to a world where technology controls and monitors individuals at every level. The idea of a \"non-sense mode\" and the presence of nano-machines suggest a highly advanced and intrusive surveillance system.\n\n3.

But in short Earth began spinning out of control &. what wasn't literally thrown into space was BBQ'd off.\n\nSome say that's it all a conspiracy and were actually living inside some science project out in the middle of the desert & \nnothing is real.\n\n\nEither way here we are. The cities or at least the parts that were able survive the tumult & the apocalyptic meltdown that followed...\n\n..signed treaties and created \n\"The Caste\" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.\n\n\nThe rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.\n\n\nEverything else, \nreligion,\n philosophy, crime, etc just kind gets in where it fits in. Not lawless but definitely \"law-least.\" Why not?\n\nWhen the very Earth you live on takes an unexpected shit on you & your way of life everything kinda goes out of focus.

Gotta be \"born\" there to live there kinda jazz. An Invitation only Taichi party for the fancy tyrant.\n\nIt's ultra-simplistic in form. Just grass, the glass buildings and the all encompassing Gravy. \nNo history, no future. Just never-ending now.\n\n\nNo pressures, no sympathies. Just calm and nihilism. Hence why 11's request, I mean threat, to bring his daughter back is so out of order.\n\nDown here in Neo-Harlem it's none of that. It's all about maximum consumption all the time. Crime & nostalgia & love & hate.\n\nLiving like no tomorrow was yesterday. Like the end of the world came and left us behind like bastards on the steps of an abandoned church.\n\nLuckily ppl still want2 find things so that keeps me employed. Luckily 4 them Im really good @ it but maybe not so lucky 4 me this time tho.\n\nI spent the night pondering my next few moves. I knew I needed a Mambo Queen and that meant going Downstairs to Neo- Orleans.\n\nFor obvious reasons I'll need a disguise.

{"tite": "Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Take on Drake v. Meek Mill", "lyrics": "The Haunting\n\nA Letter\n\n\nTo rappers from a rapper\n...simply write your own rhymes as much as you can if you are able. \nGhostwriting, or borrowing lines, or taking suggestions from the room has always been in rap and will always be in rap.\n It is nothing to go crazy over or be offended about unless you are someone who postures him or herself on the importance of authenticity and tries to portray that quality to your fans or the public at large. Then we might have a problem. \nSome of the most pivotal moments in rap have been ghostwritten verses.\n This leads to a bigger point. Rapping is not an easy thing to do. It's takes years of work and trial and error to master some of its finer points. Respect from other MC's comes in many formats. Sales, live performances, realness etc but the one thing that is the most important is the raps themselves at least in the eyes of other serious rappers. The phrase \"I'm not a rapper\" gets thrown around as if it's a badge of honor. And that's fine. If rap is a side hustle for you or just a come up then by all means may the force be with you. But I know a lot of MC's where rap is the first love and the first thing they think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about when they go to sleep. Rappers who pursue the art form with this level of intention may not become rich and famous off selling their raps to a wide audience but that has never been an accepted metric to begin with in terms of quality or level of skill. The vast majority of rappers will never sell 100 records in their lifetimes let alone millions. But that's not the point, the point is that what pursuing the craft gives us in terms of the intangibles is something that record sales or fame could never represent. We achieve a mastery of language and poetics that competes on the highest levels of discourse across the entirety of human history. We express ourselves creatively and attain a sense of liberation and self-esteem via this sacred mode of creation and communication\n\n\nModern Radio and the commercial realm of music has injured rap. \nIt set up ambiguous rules and systems for success that don't take into consideration the quality and skill of the rappers craft.\n It redefined rap as just being a beat driven hook with some words in between and an entire generation has surrendered to chasing the format instead of chasing the art form. While mastering any format should be the pursuit of any self-respecting rapper including the commercial format it must be kept clear that it is just one of many formats and that you should strive to master all of them. The art form is kept alive and progressive in the activities of the tens of thousands of rappers around the world who are everyday trying to think of that next witty bar. Trying to put that crazy verse together while at work. Trying to find that word that rhymes with catapult so they can finish off that vivid story rap about their childhood. Meek Mill struck a nerve accusing Drake of having a ghostwriter and the entire rap world reacted on all sides of the fence because rap is alive. It's active and it feels. Its rules and traditions are vibrant and responsive. I enjoy both these brothers music and find inspiration and appreciation from both of them. I remember being in Toronto at Goodfoot years ago and it was a stack of CD's on the counter and the guy behind the counter was like \"Lupe you gotta take this CD. It's my mans mixtape.\" I didn't really pay it any mind I took it to the car and looked it over and just kind of set it aside focused on other things. I vividly remember saying \"what kind of rap name is Drake?\" The rest is history. Once while in Philly I went to do an interview in a shabby and very hood basement studio complex. I peeked into one of the rooms and it was this tall kid with his shirt off bouncing up and down in the booth with an energy that was electric. I gave him my regards. He gave them back. I think I mentioned something about him cutting his dreads. As I left I remember him rapping something about being a boss. The rest is history. At the end of the day, for better or worse, rap is alive even if some of its greatest moments are written by ghosts\n\n", "summary": "The letter from a rapper addresses the issue of ghostwriting in the rap industry. The rapper emphasizes the importance of authenticity and skill in the craft of rapping, urging fellow rappers to write their own rhymes and master the art form. The letter also criticizes the commercialization of rap music, which has prioritized catchy hooks and beats over lyrical prowess.\n\nOne of the major themes in the letter is the idea of true passion and dedication to the art form of rap. The rapper acknowledges that not all rappers will achieve mainstream success, but emphasizes the intrinsic value of mastering language and poetics through rap. This dedication is contrasted with the commercialized version of rap that prioritizes sales and fame over artistic integrity.\n\nThe letter also highlights the dynamic and evolving nature of rap as an art form. The rapper acknowledges the controversy surrounding ghostwriting and the impact it has on the authenticity of the music, but ultimately recognizes that rap is a living, breathing entity that is shaped by the contributions of thousands of dedicated artists worldwide.\n\nOverall, the letter serves as a call to arms for rappers to prioritize artistic growth and expression over commercial success, and to uphold the rich traditions and rules of the rap genre. It celebrates the vibrant community of rappers who continue to push the boundaries of the art form and strive for mastery in their craft."}

{"tite": "Dear White Supremacy", "lyrics": "Dear White Supremacy,\n\nFirst of all you are not really that supreme. \nWhile throughout history White Supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions.\n \nThese positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. I mean and anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox\n. \nNot judging, just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks aren't immune to because they've never seen it doesn't make you strategically smart or tactically superior, just kind of sick.\n \nAnd these dominant positions don't really stand up to the test of time that long either.\n There is nothing about you biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy. For that matter there is also nothing about you psychologically, philosophically, cognitively, academically, socially, architecturally, culturally or even financially that signifies a higher position above any other group. \nAnd to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well. So what you really are is something in the middle. You are regular. White Regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. Black, Brown, Etc etc. But in regularity there is room for differences and this is where White Regularity shines! Each group gets the same essential universals. Dance, food, music, etc. and it must be admitted that the White Regularity take on these universal institutions has been unbelievably impressive and a great addition to the total world culture\n. \nI mean spaghetti and meatballs, Romeo & Juliet, Coldplay, The Tuxedo, lighter than air travel are all world class additions to the collective bucket\n but they are no less or more impressive than every other regular groups take on the universals either. \nAnd if we really wanted to get analytical every invention is built on inspiration from a previously existing invention\n so the claim of \"The Supreme 1st\" to do something is highly debatable and except for a few exceptions, impossible! All things human aren't born from a supreme overlord solely working in isolation.\nThings are created in collaboration and in tandem with other cultures, knowledge structures and movements and more important, People. I mean if those Muslims didn't catalog all that Greek philosophy for research we might not even know who Plato was\n. Now whether this collaboration is forced which is seen so much but not exclusively throughout human history does not take away the fact that it is done with the help of somebody else. \nWe are supreme as a spectrum of colors in collaboration. One color does not dominate the other nor can it. Sure Steve Jobs was white. But the guy who built the computer was probably Chinese. And the girl who wrote the programs for the computer is probably from Mumbai. And the raw materials that were used to make it where probably first pulled out of the ground by somebody in South Africa.\n And if you take this highly collaborated upon piece of high technology to an indigenous tribe in the jungles of Brazil they'd probably use it as a boat paddle. And we can go on and on down or up the rabbit hole all day long and you'll always find a regular somebody relying on the abilities of a just as regular somebody else that another regular somebody doesn't even care about. White Supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it. \nHere's the bad news, ain't no top. Here's the good news though, ain't no bottom neither!\n \nIt's just the regular ole middle where nobody is safe from being influenced by somebody else's extreme regularness.\n Is your swastika flag printed in Mexico? \nDid you know the swastika is officially from Asia and the subcontinent?\n \nDid you know black people had slaves in Africa too?\n \nDid you know in the world your considered a minority too?\n \nI mean you call us niggers and beaners but you gotta ship all your former Native American land backwood sourced ginseng to China to get money to support your meth habit\n. Meth that's made with chemicals produced in India. I mean Hitler hated everything about the Jews expect every possession they had. It's funny how the things you hate so much you have to rely on the most for your survival.\nAnd if you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it, White Supremacy has to validate it's on identity based solely on its relationship to other races! I mean now that's what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to supreme over! That sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid.\n \nStupid like a fox. And no not stupid like a Fox News I mean the real fox. The animal.\n\nIn closing white regularity (the race formerly know as white supremacy) I myself on behalf of my own black regularity salute you. Good luck with the northwest front I hear it's beautiful in the spring and probably a strategic death trap if and when \nYellowstone finally decides to blow up!\n\nYours Truly\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The lyrics written by Lupe Fiasco address the concept of White Supremacy and dismantle the notion of superiority based on race. The song challenges the idea that one group is inherently superior to others and highlights the collaborative nature of human achievements throughout history. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of different cultures and peoples, debunking the idea of a hierarchy based on race.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on the irony of White Supremacy relying on and being influenced by other races in various aspects of society, such as culture, technology, and economy. They expose the hypocrisy of White Supremacy, as it ultimately relies on the contributions and collaborations of people from different racial backgrounds.\n\nOverall, the song celebrates diversity and unity among all races, rejecting the idea of one group being superior to others. It encourages readers to challenge and question the narrative of White Supremacy and recognize the interconnectedness and contributions of all races to human progress."}

I (as Wasalu Jaco) started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious\n#PS\n\nI found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea I was trying to express. Layers of meaning. #PS\n\nStory of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums I will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #PS\n\nLet's have a look at the painting and the cover #PS\nThe name of the painting is in Italian \"Uomo Mangiato Tigre\" and ROUGHLY translates as \"Man Eating Tiger\" #PS\n\nSo let's start there. What is your interpretation of the title \"Man Eating Tiger\"?\nRemember to tag responses with #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco does the \"man eating tiger\" have any reflection of the issues with you as an artist (man) and your label Atl Rec (Tiger)? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco internal struggle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco natures life cycle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I feel like the meaning behind it may deal more so with how you say it not what you're saying. #PS\n\nAh! Some very early #TwitterGold from @SpeightSZN\nCare to explain what you mean by \"how you say it\"\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man desires to become part of society and in turn consumes himself #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Man conquering what would be considered a dangerous animal #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco human contamination of something more vicious than it #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man becoming more ferocious then the tiger, almost like a David Vs.

It's like a double entendre of a title. #PS\n\nAh some #TwitterGold from @jjLawson_\nSo it has two meanings?\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man destruction against the last majestic and natural strengths of our world. #PS\n\nRT: @SpeightSZN @LupeFiasco Like a play on words. The tiger has gotten a taste for human blood? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the definition I see from it stems back to Tigers being pouched by man. So eating man means self preservation and survival #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the response lines up w the islamic interpretation of the tiger representing money profits & honor which would be Atlantic #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco struggle to survive, Man eating tiger vs Man-Eating tiger #PS\n\nGreat stuff...so yes the title can be read as two ways...let's expand a little bit on that.

The artist discusses their rise to success and their ability to afford luxury items like magic shoes and expensive flights. However, they also touch on feelings of guilt and shame, possibly due to past actions or relationships. The lyrics also mention cutting ties with someone who may have been a negative influence and taking control of their own path. There is a sense of self-awareness and self-improvement, as well as a desire to move past old mistakes and focus on personal growth. The mention of a \"passenger\" who could have been with them but missed out suggests missed opportunities and potential regret. The use of metaphors like cutting checks and cutting fingers while cutting coupons adds depth to the lyrics and helps convey the emotion and complexity of the artist's experiences."}
{"tite": "Meditations On A New Diasporic Mythology Complex", "lyrics": "I think as we begin to think about myth, mythology, and the need of mythology - I was basically raised on mythology, introduced to mythology at a very young age. \nMostly Greek mythology, and of course of that Roman mythology, which kinda took over what the Greeks left off, and kinda super-imposed themselves on a lotta the Greek myths - very directly  in the form of Hercules, and the -cules.\n And that was the kind of literature I was reading as an adolescent, which became my first kind of education into creation of stories, creation of myths, and it was the role of myth being used to establish certain principles and certain narratives and certain answering of questions why in a very fantastic manner and a very supernatural manner, in that sense. But in some capacities, even a very natural manner.\n\nAnd so, once you're steeped into kinda that education; that formation; you start to think in those capacities, you start to develop your world views and your outlooks based on those kind of templates, those creation templates. As you think of, you know, that's one aspect, and you start to think of those conscious aspects consciously being attended to, and researching, and being entertained by certain narratives, mythical narrates from a certain period. And then you think of the unconscious narratives, and even you think of modern narratives, which are kind of fast-forwarded through time and the narratives which you are introduced to consciously of a more modern kind of piece: the mythology of America, the mythology of globalization, the mythology of - you know, as it stands. A myth kind of being steeped into a certain misunderstanding, and then trying to achieve the understanding reconcile of your ignorance to a certain degree through this template, this mythical template, which lays everything plain and gives you the A plus B equals C and you go on and live your life, all things are well.\n\nBut say you think of the modern mythologies, the mythology of the cowboy, the mythology of the gangsta, the mythology of just these supernatural beings - maybe not as supernatural as Zeus, of course, or Hercules, of course - but still bearing the same, some of the same fascinations with the fantastic. And these great abilities and these grand possessions and levels of influence and power, which are steeps, and the ability to influence specifically, the ability to influence discourse, the ability to influence progressions of ideas, the ability to influence women into the bed, the ability to gather large, vast quantities of material possessions, and not only have them, but to have a disdain for them; to be so above it all, once you have it where these things, where there's a certain aesthetic nature to it, that when you've consumed all of these things and at the same time you have the power to relinquish them, to show that they have no value and the way that you treat to them.\n\nAnd it's very interesting to classify that as mythology, if you know not of it, if you can't see it first-hand, if you don't really have your own creation-kind-of story as to why things are a certain revealed - it has been revealed to you that this is the way it works, these are the mechanics to this particular situation - you're gonna, in my capacity, you're gonna develop it and through myth, through your interaction with myth, through your self-creation of myth.\n\nAnd so there's a role of mythology. And I think persuing that role and taking on the role of the author of mythology. Even in the circumstance that what you are, this modern, this real -  let's call it this reality, to, you know, translate it into mythology, to regress it back into mythological kind of structure, it opens up new terrain, it opens up new frontiers for expedition: for literary expedition, for critical expedition, for poetic expedition, and from political expedition, from social expedition; and even from a historical expedition, because the nature of mythology is that it is steeped in a misunderstanding - and that misunderstanding never really becomes reconciled. It still exists, this mythology, post-misunderstanding, is really an attempt, a version, one vein in an attempt to explain or to reconcile this misunderstanding. But in it, it in itself is not a reconciliation. Reconciliation is still needed at the base, and that's why we have things like science, and different things which act upon it with all of its philosophies and its experiments and theories to try to achieve the reconciliation of the primary misunderstandings about things. Well, no matter what they are: naturals, the perceived supernaturals, the subnatural, et cetera et cetera...\n\nBut there's license. There's license to do as you will, to do as you see fit, to do that, to retain the authorial dimension of saying, \"I am going to author mythology, the new mythology - and in this particular instance, the mythology of the diaspora - so, diasporian mythology.\" Within a modern context looking backwards towards history and not in the attempt, which I think is a new way of looking at it, not in an attempt to reconcile the totality of society to this point, but more to - or I guess that is the question. What is it? Because the attempt isn't to reconcile, I mean you're not trying to reconcile a misunderstanding of what you tryin' to do. Are you just trying to promote? Or are you just trying to point attention towards the misunderstanding? But even within this, there is a reality: It's not just mythology, it is an understanding, and that might be it. It's not that it's a misunderstanding which gives birth to myth. It is a understanding, it is already reconciled, it is already consolidated, it is already real. And but from that reality it births mythology, which kinda turns things on our heads a bit, I think. Alright. DROGAS.\n\n", "summary": "The above passage delves into the importance and role of mythology in shaping individual and collective consciousness. The speaker discusses how they were introduced to mythology at a young age and how it influenced their understanding of storytelling, creation, and the establishment of principles and narratives. They explore how mythology can be used to answer questions in a fantastic and supernatural manner, while also addressing modern mythologies like the cowboy or gangsta.\n\nOne of the major themes in the passage is the idea of mythology as a way to reconcile misunderstandings or to create new narratives that give meaning to existence. The speaker discusses the role of the author in creating mythology and the potential for myth to be a tool for literary, critical, political, and social exploration.\n\nThe speaker also touches on the concept of diasporian mythology, suggesting a new way of looking at myth within the context of historical and cultural displacement. They question whether the purpose of creating new myths is to promote understanding, point out misunderstandings, or simply to draw attention to the complexities of reality.\n\nOverall, the passage explores the dual nature of mythology as both a reflection of reality and a means of transcending it through storytelling and imagination. It encourages readers to think critically about the myths that shape their worldview and to consider the power of creating new narratives to navigate the complexities of existence."}

{"tite": "The Police: A Letter", "lyrics": "A Letter\n\nThe police are not your friend. The police are not your enemy. The same could be said about the law. So let's say it. The law is not your friend and the law is not your enemy. So what are the police then if they are not friends nor enemies. Well let's get a definition of the word 'Police' from the dictionary: \"the civil force of a national or local government, responsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order.\" And while we're at it lets get a dictionary definition of 'Law' as well: \"the system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties.\" Nowhere in the definition does it say \"friend\" or \"enemy\" even though some police officers can be friendly and some can be really antagonistic (see the famed \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" routine for an explicit example) it is not the nature of their position in society to be friend or foe. So what are the police then? The firmest designation for the police is their primary title \"Law Enforcement Officer\" and again the law is neither your friend or foe so then the police are a merely reflection of the law. Police are the physical manifestation of the law. The police occupy a middle ground of sorts. They are mostly benign in the sense that if they have no particular law to enforce then they are powerless. Also where the law is broken and can't be seen or is out of the conscious knowledge of the police they are also powerless as is the law itself. Law is only powerful when it comes into direct contact with its child, Criminality. Crime and our relationship to crime is much closer to us than our relationship to the law. Everybody bends or breaks the law in some very minute capacity. We may speed on the highway from time to time. Throw litter on the ground. Lie on our taxes. Disregard a jury duty summons. Download pirated content. Where we feel the law doesn't \"count\" or \"make sense\" we are inclined to transgress the limits. Furthermore Crime is celebrated in all annals of entertainment and culture. In movies and books and song and TV. When was the last time you heard a song on the radio about the fabulous and sexy lifestyles of being a cop? In movies and TV it is much different as police officers are portrayed as being heroic figures but how many times within those same films or TV shows a police officer goes \"outside\" the law to rectify some injustice or solve some crime. How many movie cops had to \"give up their badge\" to the captain because they broke the rules to catch the bad guy? In effect they had to become criminals to enforce to the law. Think of Batman. Commissioner Gordon uses him when things get a little too out of hand in Gotham City and he needs somebody who isn't bound to the letter of the law and all that that entails to deal with the villainous hordes. This maybe \"fictional\" but then again is it really? How many real life cops put guns and drugs on people to get an arrest possibly on people who they know for a fact are committing serious crimes but can't prove it? How many cops \"invent\" a probable cause to effect a search of someone's property and eventually \"find what they were looking for\" even though what they found was not the initial reason they stopped the person? How many cops beat confessions out of people? How many cops flat out lie when it comes to what they saw or did during arrests and follow up investigations? How many cops have used terroristic threats to get people to comply to testifying or admitting to things they didn't commit? How many cops work for the same criminals they are employed to pursue in the forms of bribes and information? But then how many citizens do the same exact things? \"Police Officer\" and \"Law Enforcement Officer\" are just titles, roles, positions, names. No different than \"typewriter\" or \"car.\" What gives these things life are the people that use them. Some people just do not know how to type or drive and it must be said that some people just don't know how to be police officers in strict accordance with the law. One problem is that becoming a police officer or law enforcement officer is a very structured and ordered bureaucratic process. It is very rigid and rather systematic. It is literally uniformed to stand as the visible and physical counterpoint to the non-uniformed wildness that is on the one smaller end, society itself and on the other larger end, criminality. Crime is subtle and blends well into the wild variety of society. Crime is successful because it is asymmetric and forever evolving. It can go unnoticed. Hence why the most successful police operations are done \"undercover\" and the most visible criminal activities are the least successful. The ability to blend into the \"wildness\" of society and mimic it is the best tactic for success outside of pure anarchy. Crime is highly adaptable. It is highly revered because its heroes have excellent leadership qualities and in some cases very deep philanthropic sentiments. Crime is the true equal opportunity employer and is one of the only organizations to successfully overcome the racial divides. Criminals are the embodiment of the material American Dream. Freedom (even from taxation!), upward mobility and the pursuit of happiness. All crimes have victims but one could say quite successfully that all things have victims. In the business world, victims are classified under the term externalities. For example, some people call perfectly legal mountain top removal coal mining a crime against humanity as it has the potential to build up then completely destroy entire communities not to mention the sometimes irreversible environmental externalities. Laws sometimes have a weird way of creating their own criminal enemies, hence the \"child\" term used earlier. Take for instance prohibition, it was a perfectly sound moral concept to combat what was seen by some as the scourge of drunkenness and all its hideous social and moral externalities, just imagine drunk driving back in the 20's! This perfectly sound moral law however single handedly created the mafia, the worlds greatest and most successful organized criminal enterprise. The emergence of the mafia lead to the creation of the FBI which was needed to be a \"higher\" form of law enforcement to combat the mob. The FBI tactics included all sorts of law bending and law creation to try and successfully tackle the problem the same government that employed them unwittingly created in the first place. The cultural impact of the mafia was instantaneous and deep even up to this day. For example, we all know off top who Al Capone was but would struggle to find out who the president of the United States was during the time Al Capone was alive. And without Google today I'd say some of us would probably never know or even care to find out. The legal limits were stretched to the fight the mafia then and they are still being stretched to this day to justify your parking ticket or your \"failure to signal.\" So what does all this mean? Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Is there a solution? Unfortunately and fortunately there is no one solution. Law enforcement and criminality are like hand and glove. They are forever connected and as long as you have one you'll have the other and all the externalities from both sides that come along with them. Abuse of authority by authority will be balanced somewhere on the other side by abuse of the system by criminality. Freddy Grey dies unjustly in police custody on one side and El Chapo escapes from prison on the other side. An eye for and eye to be biblical about it. One hard solution to swallow for many is to just obey the law. Buuuuuut this \"simple\" solution also can create a set of dubious illegitimate children of its own because the law inextricably represents much more than its face value of \"do not do and you will not be punished\" for some \"obey\" is equated to \"starve\" or \"go without\" or \"be poor\" or \"be insulted\" or \"be bored\" or \"be trapped in a vicious circle of economic and academically induced depression simply because I lost the biological lottery of life and was born into a family of second or third class citizens at a time and place where social status is dictated by race which also dictates access to the apparatuses of upward mobility etc etc etc...\" Sometimes \"obey\" explicitly means die. This is the root of the plague of vendetta that is sweeping through Chicago. The ever viral and ever rational and true \"Kill Or Be Killed\" mentality. For some \"obey\" MEANS \"punishment.\" This misunderstanding of metaphorical process when it comes to how we refer, frame and live through the narratives of our individual lives is what causes much of the conflict. Objective law has little wiggle room for subjective reality. What \"law enforcement officer\" means in a dictionary and the courts can be far from the definition that it has on the streets and in practice. Police officers can be defined on the streets as surely protecting and serving but protecting and serving the wills of a corrupt authoritative system that if allowed to have its way will mean poverty forever and access denied ad infinitum. Police officers must be trained to assess not only the dangers of a situation but also the desperation of a situation. Is it just a coincidence that a synonym for criminal is \"Desperado\"? Law Enforcement has to become much more in tune and educated with the needs (material, PSYCHOLOGICAL, spiritual and cognitive) of the communities it is tasked with patrolling and if they are unable or unwilling to take on the entire scope of their position then they should find work elsewhere. Most police will respond to this by saying that such a comprehensive approach is not in there job description and will have little to no effect on the streets. One must then in reply confront them with the nature of law itself. Law is connected to the mentalities of man. It seeks to control or less invasively patrol the passions and actions of man which stem directly from his mind. And if you cannot fully comprehend the mind of a man as an externality of the environment in which he inhabits then how can you fully understand the mechanics of law itself? Again Law and the mind are like hand and glove. Some cops will say that it is for the courts to decide. However, one must argue back plainly that judges, prison guards and prosecutors don't walk the streets or patrol the beats and they rely on and TRUST police officers and their presupposed understanding of the law to bring cases before them that only meet or exceed the requirements set out by the law. That is why POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT because they are considered to be expert witnesses in terms of criminal justice and are expected to expose the very fine details of active criminality that a DA stuck in an office or a judge stuck behind a bench does not have the time nor mental hard drive space to process thoroughly. Be clear on two things: This is not meant to be a belittling or a rebuke of the police or the letter and spirit of the law. I have 3 siblings with long careers in law enforcement as police officers, correctional officers and sheriffs. This is also not an approval of criminality. I have exponentially many more family and friend who have been involved in the world of crime and it is nothing to brag about or applaud as a successful life to lead. Most of the time it has ended in death or prison or both. Both these institutions are reflections of the human condition and our understandings and misunderstandings of the way the world is \"supposed\" to work. The death of Sandra Bland is the perfect example of when these two amorphous and wandering institutions get it all the way wrong. Sandra perceived the law enforcement officer to be a law enforcement officer and all that that entails in control of his emotions and strictly subservient to the rule of law when in fact he retreated to criminality and reverted to lawlessness to prosecute what he perceived to be a disrespectful criminal threat in Sandra as opposed to her being a law abiding but pressurized citizen questioning the lawfulness of her stop. Her death in jail is a reflection of the misunderstanding of the mental pressure even the tiniest amount of perceived injustice can do to a person. While I hesitate to judge her cause of death I feel comfortable in saying that if it was suicide it speaks to the depth of the belief we as humans have in right and wrong. Sometimes people would rather die than face the injustices of this world and it doesn't need to be years or decades to decay someone to such a state it can take hours or days. Even seconds. The direct connection between The Law and The Mind is something that needs to taken very seriously by not only police officers but also by the rank and file citizen. The FULL scope of Law and Law Enforcement and Criminality and what effects they all have on the already overly sensitized and tandemically overly desensitized psyches of the communities they inhabit needs to become a dominant issue in culture. So while law enforcement officers may by definition not be our \"friends\" it might be time that they damn well think about becoming them or at least stray from acting as our enemies. And it might do us well to accept them as \"friends\" if they honestly extend the offer and not make ourselves enemies to them based on what we see in the trending multimediums as \"Brand Cop.\" Otherwise we together run the risk of giving birth to a new child, one that will feed not on milk but instead off the flesh and blood of its parents.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The letter from Lupe Fiasco explores the complex relationship between law enforcement, the law, criminality, and society as a whole. One key theme that comes through is the idea that the police are not inherently friends or enemies, but rather a reflection of the law itself. The letter also delves into the idea that crime is not always black and white, and can sometimes be a response to perceived injustices or a lack of opportunity within society. The comparison between police officers and criminals as two sides of the same coin highlights the intricate balance between upholding the law and bending it to achieve justice.\n\nAdditionally, the letter touches on the idea of mental pressure and the impact that perceived injustice can have on individuals. The tragic case of Sandra Bland serves as a poignant example of how misunderstandings and power dynamics within law enforcement can lead to devastating consequences.
