journey of self-discovery and empowerment, with a strong emphasis on reclaiming identity and heritage. The references to water, specifically walking on water like Jesus, can symbolize a sense of power and resilience. The mention of bones and the beach being white due to bleaching could represent the historical oppression and exploitation of black people, but the act of walking on water signifies rising above and overcoming these struggles.\n\nThe song also touches on themes of unity with nature, with references to the sea, forests, and stars. The narrator seems to be reflecting on the past and confronting the legacy of slavery and colonization, while also looking towards the future and a reconnection with their roots. The list of ship names in the third verse could be a reminder of the painful history of the transatlantic slave trade, but also a call to remember and honor those who suffered.\n\nOverall, the lyrics convey a message of resilience, resistance, and the importance of staying true to oneself and one's roots in the face of adversity. The imagery and metaphors used in the song help to convey these themes in a powerful and evocative way."}

The song delves into the reality of children being recruited as soldiers in war-torn areas, where they are influenced and manipulated by adults to commit acts of violence. \n\nThe lyrics paint a grim picture of children like Terry, Khalil, and Alex who are armed with guns and bombs, carrying out acts of violence without fully understanding the consequences of their actions. The song highlights the cycle of violence perpetuated by these children, as they are shaped by their environment and circumstances, ultimately becoming instruments of destruction.\n\nThe song also brings attention to the desensitization to violence that can occur through video games and media, where killing and destruction become normalized and detached from real-life consequences. The lyrics speak to the idea that the tools of war and violence, whether real or virtual, can have a significant impact on the mindset and actions of young individuals.\n\nOverall, \"Little Weapon\" serves as a poignant commentary on the devastating effects of war and violence on children, as well as the role that society, media, and technology play in perpetuating these cycles. It calls for reflection on the ways in which children are affected by and involved in acts of violence, and the need for awareness and action to break the cycle of violence."}

The song portrays the idea that American society has been built on the exploitation of marginalized communities, such as Black, Native American, and Muslim individuals. The lyrics draw parallels between historical injustices, like the treatment of Native Americans and African Americans, and current events, such as terrorism and war.\n\nThe use of metaphors, such as comparing the actions of a Muslim extremist to a Christian organization planning to poison water supplies, highlights the hypocrisy and double standards present in society. The lyrics also critique the manipulation of cultures for profit and control, as seen in the references to giving alcohol to Native Americans, drugs to Black individuals, and gambling opportunities to Asian communities.\n\nOverall, the song calls attention to the destructive effects of greed, discrimination, and power dynamics, urging listeners to challenge and resist these oppressive systems. The repeated refrain of \"American terrorist\" serves as a stark reminder of the harm caused by those in positions of authority and the urgent need for change and justice."}

The juxtaposition of \"real nigga\" and \"Twitter, what?\" suggests a contrast between authenticity and superficiality, challenging listeners to consider what it means to be true to oneself in a world that often values surface appearances over inner integrity.\n\nOverall, the lyrics in this song convey a sense of defiance, determination, and a refusal to be held back by circumstances beyond one's control. They speak to the struggle for survival, self-expression, and empowerment in the face of societal challenges and injustices."}

{"lyrics": "[Interlude: Dr. Nolan Shaw]\nAdults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, \nGod insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up.\n In other words, \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n. African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying \"thank you\" or \"no thank you\" and other forms of common courtesy. \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n\n", "summary": "The interlude by Dr. Nolan Shaw emphasizes the importance of adults in teaching children the values and traditions of their ancestors. It highlights the crucial role of parents and caregivers in nurturing and guiding the younger generation. The reference to God's instructions to talk to children at all times underscores the idea that passing down cultural values requires constant and intentional effort.\n\nThe statement \"Don't mess up the children\" serves as a powerful reminder of the impact adults have on shaping the lives and beliefs of children. It speaks to the responsibility society has in protecting and nurturing the next generation, ensuring they are raised with love, respect, and a strong sense of identity.\n\nThe mention of African American families being driven apart and children growing up without guidance highlights the larger societal issues that contribute to the erosion of cultural values. It points to the importance of community support and strong familial bonds in preserving traditions and instilling core values.\n\nOverall, the interlude reflects on the need for adults to prioritize the well-being and development of children, reminding us of our duty to pass down knowledge, wisdom, and cultural heritage to future generations. It calls for a collective effort to safeguard the innocence and potential of children, protecting them from harm and ensuring they grow up with a strong foundation of morals and values."}

The references to \"big girls don't cry\" and \"cutting back on the lies\" indicate a sense of empowerment and self-awareness, as the woman learns to trust in herself and live authentically."}

The song tells the story of a young skater who faces obstacles and criticism but continues to pursue his passion for skateboarding. Despite being told he can't skate in certain places, he and his friends defiantly continue to push forward and find their own way to express themselves.\n\nThe act of \"kick, push, coast\" on a skateboard serves as a metaphor for pushing through life's challenges, not giving up, and finding a sense of liberation and belonging in pursuing what you love. Skateboarding becomes a symbol of freedom and individuality, a way for the protagonist to escape the confines of society and express himself authentically.\n\nThe song also touches on themes of identity, belonging, and the pressure to conform. The protagonist's mixed-race background and unconventional interests set him apart from others, but he embraces his uniqueness and finds a sense of community among fellow skaters. Despite facing judgment and obstacles, he chooses to follow his own path and define success on his own terms.\n\nOverall, \"Kick, Push\" celebrates the journey of self-discovery, resilience, and the pursuit of passion, encouraging listeners to stay true to themselves and keep pushing forward, no matter the challenges they may face."}

It is \"free\" becuz it is not feared. @CalebFnCool\n[TW] @LupeFiasco occupy wall street was a powerful and dangerous free speech movement that was aimed towards eliminating US capitalism #PS\n[LP] Actually u could say the \"danger\" of OWS was mitigated becuz it was built on the powerless premise of western free speech @kamilahvictoria\n\n[TW] Salman Rushdie is more impactful in India because he is persecuted for his writings. It ironically brings exposure @LupeFiasco #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco i dont think the fact that it's free makes it less powerful, it's the intent and lack of meaning or thought behind it #ps\n[LP] Look at this way. How much to do u truly cherish something that was given to u for free as opposed to a thing u had to pay $$$ for? @cbuddz\n[TW] .@LupeFiasco but the attempt to stifle peaceful protests like Occupy shows the US government is scared of free speech #PS\n[LP] I don't think so. I think it was the OWS aesthetic that was unpleasant to the power structure. Inconvenient but no threat @JordanRaeLake\n[TW] @LupeFiasco can you use his view on free speech when he worked to leak information?\n[LP] I think the reaction to the leaks by the US is because it threatened external relations NOT the internal Western status quos @mullady21\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Free speech, rarely appreciated until it's taken away, most of our generation raised in the U.S. has never experienced this. #PS\n[LP] Does this \"taking away\" lead to a sort of resentment or anger that could possibly empower speech overall? @MIKJAGGA\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Part of this thinking is also derived from the idea that the western world is as good as it gets and can ever be #PS\n[LP] Very interesting @TravisGBTBB\n[TW] @LupeFiasco one could say that America has more of a stranglehold on their people than China does. #PS #Solzhenitsyn\n[LP] Ah the Spector of democratic tyranny... @EvansBranagh\n[TW] @LupeFiasco so our goal is to have a opinion worth silencing? Because being allowed means you and your word has no meaning.\n[LP] It may mean that silence is more powerful that words. As it removes a barometer for the power structure to \"test\" society @AvaryF\n[TW] @AvaryF @lupefiasco I feel even with an opinion worth silencing we're still somehow overshadowed by ignorance\n[LP] \"What they do not know will hurt them\" so to speak Or Biggies line \"Bad Boys move in silence.\" Limit the information accessible @AvaryF\n[TW] @LupeFiasco for example the OWS movement would be incredibly strong now had the power system not given the movement media attention #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco I would argue that Information overload functions as a form of censorship because it is almost impossible to find the truth anyway\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco speech if everyone had a Bugatti and flaunts it, it goes down in value. speech becomes an materialistic thought in this essence\n[LP] Speech defined as a being a material is very interesting. #ps #twittergold right there @xygoma_\n[TW] @LupeFiasco a politician's speech is not seen as 'powerless'. If people organised themselves better & then spoke, neither would theirs. #PS\n[LP] It can b argued tht a politicians freespeech is the least powerful of all Think of the ambiguity of the \"campaign promise\" @_MudassarRashid\n[LP] And that's #PhilosophySunday for this week.

Julian Assange's viewpoint is highlighted, stating that in the western world, free speech is allowed but ultimately ineffective in challenging power.

The notion of free speech as being devalued when it is easily obtained, compared to something that is earned or fought for, is also discussed.\n\nThe idea that silence can be more powerful than words, as it limits the information accessible to the power structure, is also touched upon. The discussion delves into the complexities of free speech and its relationship to power and control.

All his body parts are expired probably why he was getting doped up.\n\nTwo years ago he'd of been stripped clean before he hit the ground. But now designers parts are so easy to come by he's good as gum wrappers\n\n\nDon't know why they shot him though. Cops these days. You never know. Disposal might come in a couple weeks. Might not.\n\n\nValentines Day. Hookers working overtime. Flower shop empty. Whole city in love with something or atleast pretending to be.\n\n\nI step into the diner and work my way through the crowd waiting on tables to steal a seat at the counter. It's always a seat there.\n\n\n5 coffees, 3 grits, 6 eggs, 2 toasts, 9 sausage.\n She hands over the \nglasses\n. I inform her these are dirty. She doesn't care.\n\nI wipe them on my jacket and put them on. 5 blinks equal 25 Units. She slides me the black tray with the pills and sneers out \"Bon Apetite\"\n\n\nUnits are stored in the eyes. Blinking releases Units into receiving glasses or goggles or contacts and your purchase is complete.\n\n\nThey updated the toast. Coffee is still terrible. I spot Tall Creole at the end of the counter popping back Gin pills raw. A reality freak.\n\n\nI look back down with my eyes half over the top of the glasses\n & see the \nblack tray in the glasses I see a plate overflowing with breakfast.\n\n\nI like to stay one foot in & one foot out I guess. I can take being lied to. Being a liar comes easy too. Here its an expectation of sorts.\n\nThe human body still isn't used to digesting pill food properly. Updating is a constant to combat the side effects. Shakes, vomiting etc.\n\n\nBetter than real food though. That shit will kill you. So many additives and molecular advertising in it it's damn near plastic.\n\n\nTall Creole shakes violently, damn near falls off stool. She's almost ready 4 the night to take her. I hope she makes it out the other side.\n\nI grab the Shake Handles connected to the stool and prepare for my turn. It comes. I wink a tip. Take off the glasses & head into the nite.\n\n---1 Million Units Respond For Details--- glows in the left hand corner of my mind. I've been thinking about it this whole time.\n\nSounds like a set up to be honest. 1 Millions Units is the apple but who is the devil on the other side. I guess that makes me Adam. No Eve!\n\n\"Playback Tall Creole\" half my mind rewinds back to my thick-legged tail as she followed me into the diner recording me as I recorded her.\n\nNow we have our Eve, Adam & The Apple. Now we just need The Devil. Sometimes the best place to find the devil is in the mirror. Lets see.\n\n---This is Teriyaki Joe...What Are The Details??---\n\n*...END OF CHAPTER 2...*\n\n", "summary": "The above chapter from \"Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective\" is rich with themes and metaphors that explore a futuristic, dystopian society. The protagonist, Teriyaki Joe, navigates through a world where body parts are easily replaceable, consumption of pill food is normalized, and reality is distorted. \n\nThe reference to hackers infiltrating Joe's MindPhone and leaving messages suggests a sense of invasion and manipulation, reflecting the theme of control and surveillance in society. The concept of Units being stored in the eyes and released through blinking to make purchases highlights the commodification of human experiences and interactions.\n\nThe diner setting serves as a contrast between the illusion of love and connection on Valentine's Day, with the harsh reality of a society obsessed with artificial enhancements and quick fixes. The characters, such as Tall Creole, symbolize the struggles and dangers of trying to navigate through a world built on deception and false appearances.\n\nThe use of biblical references, such as Adam, Eve, and the Devil, add a layer of complexity to the narrative, suggesting a moral ambiguity and the constant battle between good and evil within oneself and society. The ending, with Joe questioning who the Devil may be, hints at a deeper exploration of identity, morality, and understanding in a world where truth is subjective.\n\nOverall, the chapter delves into themes of manipulation, deception, identity, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion in a society that values convenience and superficiality over authenticity. It challenges the reader to question their own perceptions and assumptions about the world they inhabit."}

I mean the best of us should travel with a little more class and dignity.\n\nThis is like being in a port-o-potty with thrusters. A couple coughs. A well aimed spit. Yeah thats how the \"Best Of Us\" do it, precisely.\n\nUp through the clouds. Directly into the Moon. We pass through it. It's only a meter thick. So warm. So fake. Color is still wrong to me.\n\nThe cab slows to a halt. Border patrol scans the ID tags. All clear. One step down. \nDisinfection nozzles spray the cab down.\n Missed a spot.\n\n\nStep three is up next. Blindness. Total sensory disconnect. 3 seconds. 3 weeks.

We call it the basement\n\nUnderneath that in no particular order is Old London, Sau Paulo, what's left of Los Angeles & Moscow and that's pretty much it\n\n\nCity states stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob.\n Earth decided to a go a little nuts orbitally speaking.\n\nScientist still can't explain it. But in short Earth began spinning out of control &. what wasn't literally thrown into space was BBQ'd off.\n\nSome say that's it all a conspiracy and were actually living inside some science project out in the middle of the desert & \nnothing is real.\n\n\nEither way here we are. The cities or at least the parts that were able survive the tumult & the apocalyptic meltdown that followed...\n\n..signed treaties and created \n\"The Caste\" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.\n\n\nThe rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.\n\n\nEverything else, \nreligion,\n philosophy, crime, etc just kind gets in where it fits in. Not lawless but definitely \"law-least.\" Why not?\n\nWhen the very Earth you live on takes an unexpected shit on you & your way of life everything kinda goes out of focus. Welcome to the blur.\n\n\nThe position of the real Sun over Central Park hasn't changed in about 100 years.\n If it wasn't 4 the Nano-Gravy it would've been burned away.\n\nIt's literally the tip of the iceberg. Gotta be \"born\" there to live there kinda jazz. An Invitation only Taichi party for the fancy tyrant.\n\nIt's ultra-simplistic in form. Just grass, the glass buildings and the all encompassing Gravy. \nNo history, no future. Just never-ending now.\n\n\nNo pressures, no sympathies. Just calm and nihilism. Hence why 11's request, I mean threat, to bring his daughter back is so out of order.\n\nDown here in Neo-Harlem it's none of that. It's all about maximum consumption all the time. Crime & nostalgia & love & hate.\n\nLiving like no tomorrow was yesterday. Like the end of the world came and left us behind like bastards on the steps of an abandoned church.\n\nLuckily ppl still want2 find things so that keeps me employed. Luckily 4 them Im really good @ it but maybe not so lucky 4 me this time tho.\n\nI spent the night pondering my next few moves. I knew I needed a Mambo Queen and that meant going Downstairs to Neo- Orleans.\n\nFor obvious reasons I'll need a disguise.

The idea of living in a world where the Earth itself has turned against its inhabitants emphasizes the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the world in which the characters of the story exist.\n\nThe mention of a Mambo Queen and the need for a disguise to navigate different levels of society hint at themes of deception, manipulation, and the search for power and information. The references to Eve and the Apple tree add a biblical undertone to the narrative, suggesting themes of temptation, knowledge, and the consequences of seeking forbidden truths.\n\nOverall, these lyrics convey a sense of urgency, mystery, and intrigue as the protagonist navigates a dangerous and uncertain world in search of answers and solutions to the challenges he faces."}

{"lyrics": "The Haunting\n\nA Letter\n\n\nTo rappers from a rapper\n...simply write your own rhymes as much as you can if you are able. \nGhostwriting, or borrowing lines, or taking suggestions from the room has always been in rap and will always be in rap.\n It is nothing to go crazy over or be offended about unless you are someone who postures him or herself on the importance of authenticity and tries to portray that quality to your fans or the public at large. Then we might have a problem. \nSome of the most pivotal moments in rap have been ghostwritten verses.\n This leads to a bigger point. Rapping is not an easy thing to do. It's takes years of work and trial and error to master some of its finer points. Respect from other MC's comes in many formats. Sales, live performances, realness etc but the one thing that is the most important is the raps themselves at least in the eyes of other serious rappers. The phrase \"I'm not a rapper\" gets thrown around as if it's a badge of honor. And that's fine. If rap is a side hustle for you or just a come up then by all means may the force be with you. But I know a lot of MC's where rap is the first love and the first thing they think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about when they go to sleep. Rappers who pursue the art form with this level of intention may not become rich and famous off selling their raps to a wide audience but that has never been an accepted metric to begin with in terms of quality or level of skill. The vast majority of rappers will never sell 100 records in their lifetimes let alone millions. But that's not the point, the point is that what pursuing the craft gives us in terms of the intangibles is something that record sales or fame could never represent. We achieve a mastery of language and poetics that competes on the highest levels of discourse across the entirety of human history. We express ourselves creatively and attain a sense of liberation and self-esteem via this sacred mode of creation and communication\n\n\nModern Radio and the commercial realm of music has injured rap. \nIt set up ambiguous rules and systems for success that don't take into consideration the quality and skill of the rappers craft.\n It redefined rap as just being a beat driven hook with some words in between and an entire generation has surrendered to chasing the format instead of chasing the art form. While mastering any format should be the pursuit of any self-respecting rapper including the commercial format it must be kept clear that it is just one of many formats and that you should strive to master all of them. The art form is kept alive and progressive in the activities of the tens of thousands of rappers around the world who are everyday trying to think of that next witty bar. Trying to put that crazy verse together while at work. Trying to find that word that rhymes with catapult so they can finish off that vivid story rap about their childhood. Meek Mill struck a nerve accusing Drake of having a ghostwriter and the entire rap world reacted on all sides of the fence because rap is alive. It's active and it feels. Its rules and traditions are vibrant and responsive. I enjoy both these brothers music and find inspiration and appreciation from both of them. I remember being in Toronto at Goodfoot years ago and it was a stack of CD's on the counter and the guy behind the counter was like \"Lupe you gotta take this CD. It's my mans mixtape.\" I didn't really pay it any mind I took it to the car and looked it over and just kind of set it aside focused on other things. I vividly remember saying \"what kind of rap name is Drake?\" The rest is history. Once while in Philly I went to do an interview in a shabby and very hood basement studio complex. I peeked into one of the rooms and it was this tall kid with his shirt off bouncing up and down in the booth with an energy that was electric. I gave him my regards. He gave them back. I think I mentioned something about him cutting his dreads. As I left I remember him rapping something about being a boss. The rest is history. At the end of the day, for better or worse, rap is alive even if some of its greatest moments are written by ghosts\n\n", "summary": "The letter from the rapper addresses the issue of ghostwriting in the rap industry. The rapper acknowledges that ghostwriting has always been a part of rap culture, but emphasizes that authenticity is important, especially for those who claim to be real and genuine in their lyrics. The letter also highlights the dedication and skill required to master the art of rapping, pointing out that true MCs are passionate about the craft and constantly strive to improve their skills.\n\nThe rapper criticizes modern radio and the commercialization of rap, arguing that it has led to a focus on formulaic, profit-driven music that neglects the true essence of the art form. The letter encourages rappers to master different formats and to continue pushing the boundaries of creativity in order to keep rap alive and evolving.\n\nThe letter references the controversy between Meek Mill and Drake over ghostwriting, underscoring the emotional and active nature of rap as a genre. The rapper also shares personal anecdotes about encountering both Drake and Meek Mill before they achieved fame, highlighting how their hard work and dedication ultimately led to their success in the industry.\n\nOverall, the letter celebrates the vibrancy and diversity of rap as an art form, acknowledging that even if some of the greatest moments in rap are written by ghostwriters, the essence of rap is still alive and thriving through the dedication and passion of true MCs."}

{"lyrics": "Dear White Supremacy,\n\nFirst of all you are not really that supreme. \nWhile throughout history White Supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions.\n \nThese positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. I mean and anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox\n. \nNot judging, just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks aren't immune to because they've never seen it doesn't make you strategically smart or tactically superior, just kind of sick.\n \nAnd these dominant positions don't really stand up to the test of time that long either.\n There is nothing about you biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy. For that matter there is also nothing about you psychologically, philosophically, cognitively, academically, socially, architecturally, culturally or even financially that signifies a higher position above any other group. \nAnd to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well. So what you really are is something in the middle. You are regular. White Regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. Black, Brown, Etc etc. But in regularity there is room for differences and this is where White Regularity shines! Each group gets the same essential universals. Dance, food, music, etc. and it must be admitted that the White Regularity take on these universal institutions has been unbelievably impressive and a great addition to the total world culture\n. \nI mean spaghetti and meatballs, Romeo & Juliet, Coldplay, The Tuxedo, lighter than air travel are all world class additions to the collective bucket\n but they are no less or more impressive than every other regular groups take on the universals either. \nAnd if we really wanted to get analytical every invention is built on inspiration from a previously existing invention\n so the claim of \"The Supreme 1st\" to do something is highly debatable and except for a few exceptions, impossible! All things human aren't born from a supreme overlord solely working in isolation.\nThings are created in collaboration and in tandem with other cultures, knowledge structures and movements and more important, People. I mean if those Muslims didn't catalog all that Greek philosophy for research we might not even know who Plato was\n. Now whether this collaboration is forced which is seen so much but not exclusively throughout human history does not take away the fact that it is done with the help of somebody else. \nWe are supreme as a spectrum of colors in collaboration. One color does not dominate the other nor can it. Sure Steve Jobs was white. But the guy who built the computer was probably Chinese. And the girl who wrote the programs for the computer is probably from Mumbai. And the raw materials that were used to make it where probably first pulled out of the ground by somebody in South Africa.\n And if you take this highly collaborated upon piece of high technology to an indigenous tribe in the jungles of Brazil they'd probably use it as a boat paddle. And we can go on and on down or up the rabbit hole all day long and you'll always find a regular somebody relying on the abilities of a just as regular somebody else that another regular somebody doesn't even care about. White Supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it. \nHere's the bad news, ain't no top. Here's the good news though, ain't no bottom neither!\n \nIt's just the regular ole middle where nobody is safe from being influenced by somebody else's extreme regularness.\n Is your swastika flag printed in Mexico? \nDid you know the swastika is officially from Asia and the subcontinent?\n \nDid you know black people had slaves in Africa too?\n \nDid you know in the world your considered a minority too?\n \nI mean you call us niggers and beaners but you gotta ship all your former Native American land backwood sourced ginseng to China to get money to support your meth habit\n. Meth that's made with chemicals produced in India. I mean Hitler hated everything about the Jews expect every possession they had. It's funny how the things you hate so much you have to rely on the most for your survival.\nAnd if you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it, White Supremacy has to validate it's on identity based solely on its relationship to other races! I mean now that's what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to supreme over! That sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid.\n \nStupid like a fox. And no not stupid like a Fox News I mean the real fox. The animal.\n\nIn closing white regularity (the race formerly know as white supremacy) I myself on behalf of my own black regularity salute you. Good luck with the northwest front I hear it's beautiful in the spring and probably a strategic death trap if and when \nYellowstone finally decides to blow up!\n\nYours Truly\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The above lyrics address the concept of white supremacy and dismantle the idea of white superiority. The writer highlights how white supremacy is not actually supreme, but rather just a regular part of the human spectrum. They emphasize the collaborative nature of human progress and innovation, pointing out that inventions and advancements are often built upon the work of many different cultures and people.\n\nThe lyrics also criticize the arrogance and ignorance of white supremacy, pointing out the irony that the things they hate or denounce are often essential to their own survival and well-being. The writer challenges the notion of white supremacy by showing how interconnected and interdependent all races and cultures are.\n\nOverall, the lyrics serve as a powerful critique of white supremacy and the false hierarchies it creates. The writer celebrates the diversity and contributions of all races and cultures, reminding us that there is no inherent superiority or inferiority based on race. The message is one of unity, collaboration, and mutual respect among all races and peoples."}

Abloh prompts us to ponder where we sit in the vast expanse of the solar system and amongst the stars. This can be seen as a metaphor for questioning our place and significance in the greater scheme of things.\n\nHe also explores the idea of man-made constructs and their impact on our understanding of the world. Whether it be the concept of a house or the history of art, these are all constructs created by humans that shape our understanding of the world around us. He raises the idea of perspective and how what may seem normal or familiar to us can be completely different for someone from a different background or culture.\n\nThe overarching message seems to be a reflection on the power and influence of humanity in shaping our world, for better or for worse.

I (as Wasalu Jaco) started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious\n#PS\n\nI found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea I was trying to express. Layers of meaning. #PS\n\nStory of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums I will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #PS\n\nLet's have a look at the painting and the cover #PS\nThe name of the painting is in Italian \"Uomo Mangiato Tigre\" and ROUGHLY translates as \"Man Eating Tiger\" #PS\n\nSo let's start there. What is your interpretation of the title \"Man Eating Tiger\"?\nRemember to tag responses with #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco does the \"man eating tiger\" have any reflection of the issues with you as an artist (man) and your label Atl Rec (Tiger)? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco internal struggle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco natures life cycle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I feel like the meaning behind it may deal more so with how you say it not what you're saying. #PS\n\nAh!

{"lyrics": "I think as we begin to think about myth, mythology, and the need of mythology - I was basically raised on mythology, introduced to mythology at a very young age. \nMostly Greek mythology, and of course of that Roman mythology, which kinda took over what the Greeks left off, and kinda super-imposed themselves on a lotta the Greek myths - very directly  in the form of Hercules, and the -cules.\n And that was the kind of literature I was reading as an adolescent, which became my first kind of education into creation of stories, creation of myths, and it was the role of myth being used to establish certain principles and certain narratives and certain answering of questions why in a very fantastic manner and a very supernatural manner, in that sense. But in some capacities, even a very natural manner.\n\nAnd so, once you're steeped into kinda that education; that formation; you start to think in those capacities, you start to develop your world views and your outlooks based on those kind of templates, those creation templates. As you think of, you know, that's one aspect, and you start to think of those conscious aspects consciously being attended to, and researching, and being entertained by certain narratives, mythical narrates from a certain period. And then you think of the unconscious narratives, and even you think of modern narratives, which are kind of fast-forwarded through time and the narratives which you are introduced to consciously of a more modern kind of piece: the mythology of America, the mythology of globalization, the mythology of - you know, as it stands. A myth kind of being steeped into a certain misunderstanding, and then trying to achieve the understanding reconcile of your ignorance to a certain degree through this template, this mythical template, which lays everything plain and gives you the A plus B equals C and you go on and live your life, all things are well.\n\nBut say you think of the modern mythologies, the mythology of the cowboy, the mythology of the gangsta, the mythology of just these supernatural beings - maybe not as supernatural as Zeus, of course, or Hercules, of course - but still bearing the same, some of the same fascinations with the fantastic. And these great abilities and these grand possessions and levels of influence and power, which are steeps, and the ability to influence specifically, the ability to influence discourse, the ability to influence progressions of ideas, the ability to influence women into the bed, the ability to gather large, vast quantities of material possessions, and not only have them, but to have a disdain for them; to be so above it all, once you have it where these things, where there's a certain aesthetic nature to it, that when you've consumed all of these things and at the same time you have the power to relinquish them, to show that they have no value and the way that you treat to them.\n\nAnd it's very interesting to classify that as mythology, if you know not of it, if you can't see it first-hand, if you don't really have your own creation-kind-of story as to why things are a certain revealed - it has been revealed to you that this is the way it works, these are the mechanics to this particular situation - you're gonna, in my capacity, you're gonna develop it and through myth, through your interaction with myth, through your self-creation of myth.\n\nAnd so there's a role of mythology. And I think persuing that role and taking on the role of the author of mythology. Even in the circumstance that what you are, this modern, this real -  let's call it this reality, to, you know, translate it into mythology, to regress it back into mythological kind of structure, it opens up new terrain, it opens up new frontiers for expedition: for literary expedition, for critical expedition, for poetic expedition, and from political expedition, from social expedition; and even from a historical expedition, because the nature of mythology is that it is steeped in a misunderstanding - and that misunderstanding never really becomes reconciled. It still exists, this mythology, post-misunderstanding, is really an attempt, a version, one vein in an attempt to explain or to reconcile this misunderstanding. But in it, it in itself is not a reconciliation. Reconciliation is still needed at the base, and that's why we have things like science, and different things which act upon it with all of its philosophies and its experiments and theories to try to achieve the reconciliation of the primary misunderstandings about things. Well, no matter what they are: naturals, the perceived supernaturals, the subnatural, et cetera et cetera...\n\nBut there's license. There's license to do as you will, to do as you see fit, to do that, to retain the authorial dimension of saying, \"I am going to author mythology, the new mythology - and in this particular instance, the mythology of the diaspora - so, diasporian mythology.\" Within a modern context looking backwards towards history and not in the attempt, which I think is a new way of looking at it, not in an attempt to reconcile the totality of society to this point, but more to - or I guess that is the question. What is it? Because the attempt isn't to reconcile, I mean you're not trying to reconcile a misunderstanding of what you tryin' to do. Are you just trying to promote? Or are you just trying to point attention towards the misunderstanding? But even within this, there is a reality: It's not just mythology, it is an understanding, and that might be it. It's not that it's a misunderstanding which gives birth to myth. It is a understanding, it is already reconciled, it is already consolidated, it is already real. And but from that reality it births mythology, which kinda turns things on our heads a bit, I think. Alright. DROGAS.\n\n", "summary": "The above lyrics explore the role of mythology in shaping our understanding of the world and ourselves. The speaker reflects on their upbringing surrounded by Greek and Roman mythology and how it influenced their way of thinking and storytelling. They discuss the power of myth to establish principles, provide answers to questions, and offer a fantastical or supernatural perspective on reality.\n\nThe speaker also delves into the idea of modern mythologies, such as the cowboy or gangsta, and how they play a role in influencing discourse, ideas, and societal norms. They suggest that individuals can create their own mythology based on their experiences and interactions with the world, ultimately becoming the author of their own myth.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on the concept of reconciliation in mythology, highlighting the tension between misunderstanding and understanding. The speaker suggests that mythology arises not from a complete misunderstanding, but from a deeper understanding of reality that gives birth to mythical narratives. They question whether the purpose of creating new mythology is to promote certain ideas or to draw attention to existing misunderstandings.\n\nOverall, the lyrics explore the complex relationship between mythology, reality, and understanding, and invite the listener to consider the ways in which we shape our own stories and myths to make sense of the world."}

{"lyrics": "A Letter\n\nThe police are not your friend. The police are not your enemy. The same could be said about the law. So let's say it. The law is not your friend and the law is not your enemy. So what are the police then if they are not friends nor enemies. Well let's get a definition of the word 'Police' from the dictionary: \"the civil force of a national or local government, responsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order.\" And while we're at it lets get a dictionary definition of 'Law' as well: \"the system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties.\" Nowhere in the definition does it say \"friend\" or \"enemy\" even though some police officers can be friendly and some can be really antagonistic (see the famed \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" routine for an explicit example) it is not the nature of their position in society to be friend or foe. So what are the police then? The firmest designation for the police is their primary title \"Law Enforcement Officer\" and again the law is neither your friend or foe so then the police are a merely reflection of the law. Police are the physical manifestation of the law. The police occupy a middle ground of sorts. They are mostly benign in the sense that if they have no particular law to enforce then they are powerless. Also where the law is broken and can't be seen or is out of the conscious knowledge of the police they are also powerless as is the law itself. Law is only powerful when it comes into direct contact with its child, Criminality. Crime and our relationship to crime is much closer to us than our relationship to the law. Everybody bends or breaks the law in some very minute capacity. We may speed on the highway from time to time. Throw litter on the ground. Lie on our taxes. Disregard a jury duty summons. Download pirated content. Where we feel the law doesn't \"count\" or \"make sense\" we are inclined to transgress the limits. Furthermore Crime is celebrated in all annals of entertainment and culture. In movies and books and song and TV. When was the last time you heard a song on the radio about the fabulous and sexy lifestyles of being a cop? In movies and TV it is much different as police officers are portrayed as being heroic figures but how many times within those same films or TV shows a police officer goes \"outside\" the law to rectify some injustice or solve some crime. How many movie cops had to \"give up their badge\" to the captain because they broke the rules to catch the bad guy? In effect they had to become criminals to enforce to the law. Think of Batman. Commissioner Gordon uses him when things get a little too out of hand in Gotham City and he needs somebody who isn't bound to the letter of the law and all that that entails to deal with the villainous hordes. This maybe \"fictional\" but then again is it really? How many real life cops put guns and drugs on people to get an arrest possibly on people who they know for a fact are committing serious crimes but can't prove it? How many cops \"invent\" a probable cause to effect a search of someone's property and eventually \"find what they were looking for\" even though what they found was not the initial reason they stopped the person? How many cops beat confessions out of people? How many cops flat out lie when it comes to what they saw or did during arrests and follow up investigations? How many cops have used terroristic threats to get people to comply to testifying or admitting to things they didn't commit? How many cops work for the same criminals they are employed to pursue in the forms of bribes and information? But then how many citizens do the same exact things? \"Police Officer\" and \"Law Enforcement Officer\" are just titles, roles, positions, names. No different than \"typewriter\" or \"car.\" What gives these things life are the people that use them. Some people just do not know how to type or drive and it must be said that some people just don't know how to be police officers in strict accordance with the law. One problem is that becoming a police officer or law enforcement officer is a very structured and ordered bureaucratic process. It is very rigid and rather systematic. It is literally uniformed to stand as the visible and physical counterpoint to the non-uniformed wildness that is on the one smaller end, society itself and on the other larger end, criminality. Crime is subtle and blends well into the wild variety of society. Crime is successful because it is asymmetric and forever evolving. It can go unnoticed. Hence why the most successful police operations are done \"undercover\" and the most visible criminal activities are the least successful. The ability to blend into the \"wildness\" of society and mimic it is the best tactic for success outside of pure anarchy. Crime is highly adaptable. It is highly revered because its heroes have excellent leadership qualities and in some cases very deep philanthropic sentiments. Crime is the true equal opportunity employer and is one of the only organizations to successfully overcome the racial divides. Criminals are the embodiment of the material American Dream. Freedom (even from taxation!), upward mobility and the pursuit of happiness. All crimes have victims but one could say quite successfully that all things have victims. In the business world, victims are classified under the term externalities. For example, some people call perfectly legal mountain top removal coal mining a crime against humanity as it has the potential to build up then completely destroy entire communities not to mention the sometimes irreversible environmental externalities. Laws sometimes have a weird way of creating their own criminal enemies, hence the \"child\" term used earlier. Take for instance prohibition, it was a perfectly sound moral concept to combat what was seen by some as the scourge of drunkenness and all its hideous social and moral externalities, just imagine drunk driving back in the 20's! This perfectly sound moral law however single handedly created the mafia, the worlds greatest and most successful organized criminal enterprise. The emergence of the mafia lead to the creation of the FBI which was needed to be a \"higher\" form of law enforcement to combat the mob. The FBI tactics included all sorts of law bending and law creation to try and successfully tackle the problem the same government that employed them unwittingly created in the first place. The cultural impact of the mafia was instantaneous and deep even up to this day. For example, we all know off top who Al Capone was but would struggle to find out who the president of the United States was during the time Al Capone was alive. And without Google today I'd say some of us would probably never know or even care to find out. The legal limits were stretched to the fight the mafia then and they are still being stretched to this day to justify your parking ticket or your \"failure to signal.\" So what does all this mean? Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Is there a solution? Unfortunately and fortunately there is no one solution. Law enforcement and criminality are like hand and glove. They are forever connected and as long as you have one you'll have the other and all the externalities from both sides that come along with them. Abuse of authority by authority will be balanced somewhere on the other side by abuse of the system by criminality. Freddy Grey dies unjustly in police custody on one side and El Chapo escapes from prison on the other side. An eye for and eye to be biblical about it. One hard solution to swallow for many is to just obey the law. Buuuuuut this \"simple\" solution also can create a set of dubious illegitimate children of its own because the law inextricably represents much more than its face value of \"do not do and you will not be punished\" for some \"obey\" is equated to \"starve\" or \"go without\" or \"be poor\" or \"be insulted\" or \"be bored\" or \"be trapped in a vicious circle of economic and academically induced depression simply because I lost the biological lottery of life and was born into a family of second or third class citizens at a time and place where social status is dictated by race which also dictates access to the apparatuses of upward mobility etc etc etc...\" Sometimes \"obey\" explicitly means die. This is the root of the plague of vendetta that is sweeping through Chicago. The ever viral and ever rational and true \"Kill Or Be Killed\" mentality. For some \"obey\" MEANS \"punishment.\" This misunderstanding of metaphorical process when it comes to how we refer, frame and live through the narratives of our individual lives is what causes much of the conflict. Objective law has little wiggle room for subjective reality. What \"law enforcement officer\" means in a dictionary and the courts can be far from the definition that it has on the streets and in practice. Police officers can be defined on the streets as surely protecting and serving but protecting and serving the wills of a corrupt authoritative system that if allowed to have its way will mean poverty forever and access denied ad infinitum. Police officers must be trained to assess not only the dangers of a situation but also the desperation of a situation. Is it just a coincidence that a synonym for criminal is \"Desperado\"? Law Enforcement has to become much more in tune and educated with the needs (material, PSYCHOLOGICAL, spiritual and cognitive) of the communities it is tasked with patrolling and if they are unable or unwilling to take on the entire scope of their position then they should find work elsewhere. Most police will respond to this by saying that such a comprehensive approach is not in there job description and will have little to no effect on the streets. One must then in reply confront them with the nature of law itself. Law is connected to the mentalities of man. It seeks to control or less invasively patrol the passions and actions of man which stem directly from his mind. And if you cannot fully comprehend the mind of a man as an externality of the environment in which he inhabits then how can you fully understand the mechanics of law itself? Again Law and the mind are like hand and glove. Some cops will say that it is for the courts to decide. However, one must argue back plainly that judges, prison guards and prosecutors don't walk the streets or patrol the beats and they rely on and TRUST police officers and their presupposed understanding of the law to bring cases before them that only meet or exceed the requirements set out by the law. That is why POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT because they are considered to be expert witnesses in terms of criminal justice and are expected to expose the very fine details of active criminality that a DA stuck in an office or a judge stuck behind a bench does not have the time nor mental hard drive space to process thoroughly. Be clear on two things: This is not meant to be a belittling or a rebuke of the police or the letter and spirit of the law. I have 3 siblings with long careers in law enforcement as police officers, correctional officers and sheriffs. This is also not an approval of criminality. I have exponentially many more family and friend who have been involved in the world of crime and it is nothing to brag about or applaud as a successful life to lead. Most of the time it has ended in death or prison or both. Both these institutions are reflections of the human condition and our understandings and misunderstandings of the way the world is \"supposed\" to work. The death of Sandra Bland is the perfect example of when these two amorphous and wandering institutions get it all the way wrong. Sandra perceived the law enforcement officer to be a law enforcement officer and all that that entails in control of his emotions and strictly subservient to the rule of law when in fact he retreated to criminality and reverted to lawlessness to prosecute what he perceived to be a disrespectful criminal threat in Sandra as opposed to her being a law abiding but pressurized citizen questioning the lawfulness of her stop. Her death in jail is a reflection of the misunderstanding of the mental pressure even the tiniest amount of perceived injustice can do to a person. While I hesitate to judge her cause of death I feel comfortable in saying that if it was suicide it speaks to the depth of the belief we as humans have in right and wrong. Sometimes people would rather die than face the injustices of this world and it doesn't need to be years or decades to decay someone to such a state it can take hours or days. Even seconds. The direct connection between The Law and The Mind is something that needs to taken very seriously by not only police officers but also by the rank and file citizen. The FULL scope of Law and Law Enforcement and Criminality and what effects they all have on the already overly sensitized and tandemically overly desensitized psyches of the communities they inhabit needs to become a dominant issue in culture. So while law enforcement officers may by definition not be our \"friends\" it might be time that they damn well think about becoming them or at least stray from acting as our enemies. And it might do us well to accept them as \"friends\" if they honestly extend the offer and not make ourselves enemies to them based on what we see in the trending multimediums as \"Brand Cop.\" Otherwise we together run the risk of giving birth to a new child, one that will feed not on milk but instead off the flesh and blood of its parents.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The letter addresses the complex relationship between law enforcement, the law, criminality, and society. It delves into the idea that police officers are neither friends nor enemies but rather reflections of the law they are tasked with upholding. It highlights the blurred lines between obeying the law and facing unjust consequences, using examples from history and popular culture to illustrate the intricacies of this relationship.\n\nThe letter also delves into the psychological impact of law enforcement on communities, emphasizing the need for officers to understand the needs and struggles of the people they serve. It touches on the tragic consequences of misunderstandings and injustices, using the case of Sandra Bland as a poignant example.\n\nOverall, the letter urges both law enforcement officers and citizens to consider the deeper implications of their actions and interactions within the realm of the law. It calls for empathy, understanding, and a reevaluation of the dynamics between authority, criminality, and societal norms."}

The cat is described as having a high level of toxoplasmosis, which is a parasite that can affect the brain and behavior of the host. This could be interpreted as the cat having a wild and unpredictable nature.\n\nThe lyrics also mention the cat getting into trouble, such as catching rats and causing chaos in its habitat. The cat is portrayed as being cunning and resourceful, able to navigate various situations and environments.\n\nThere are also references to luxury and opulence, such as mentioning Oprah and gift cards, juxtaposed with the cat's more primal instincts like catching prey. This could symbolize the duality of the cat's nature, both sophisticated and instinctual.\n\nOverall, these lyrics paint a vivid and somewhat eccentric picture of a cat living on the edge, navigating the world with a mix of charm, danger, and mystery."}
