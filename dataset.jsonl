Lupe Fiasco's verses, on the other hand, delve into a more complex and dark reality. He talks about feeling detached from the world, using a giant robot as a metaphor for protection and separation. The imagery in his lyrics paints a picture of a gritty urban environment filled with crime, corruption, and inequality.\n\nThe second verse specifically criticizes the glorification of drugs, objectification of women, and materialism in the entertainment industry. Lupe seems to be reflecting on his own experiences and struggles with staying true to himself in the face of societal pressures and temptations.\n\nOverall, the song explores the tension between escapism and reality, the influence of external forces on individuals, and the struggle to maintain authenticity in a world that constantly bombards us with superficial distractions. It's a thought-provoking commentary on the complexities of modern life and the human desire for connection and meaning amidst chaos."}

The mention of giving \"red man liquor\" and \"yellow man tool\" speaks to the systematic marginalization and exploitation of these communities for the benefit of others.\n\nThe song also delves into the concept of terrorism, not just in a traditional sense, but also in terms of the ways in which power structures and systems can terrorize and oppress certain groups. The lyrics challenge the idea of who is labeled as a terrorist and questions the motives behind certain actions that are seen as justified.\n\nOverall, the song serves as a critique of the ways in which greed, power, and ignorance can lead to the perpetuation of violence, discrimination, and injustice. It urges listeners to think critically about the systems in place and to strive for a more just and equitable society."}

When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together? Language. \"This world will become one, I have found the way. Race, tribal affiliations, national borders - even our faces will be irrelevant. The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\n\nFound a friend in the words and my words and it works\nTake away the pain, take away the hurt\n\n\nMake a way to make a change, make it sane\nSpecially if you plan on staying on this Earth\n\n\nLow to the lows, high to the highs\n\n\nEyes to the sky, strive to revive, dying to survive\n\n\nPool full of cries but it's cool, I'm still alive\n\n\nAnd every breath is every left soul\n\n\nAnd the family never kept whole\n\n\nIn the slum, want to quest to be the best of being less\nNever let go, the best road to the next level\nAnd the scenes where it's mean to do the right thing\nNot to be a good king but the best devil\n\n\nSo it's horns for the crown, torn from the ground\nRoses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days\n\n\nLook at them rain down\n\n\nI was brought here a slave\nBut I leave here a pharaoh\n\n\n[Interlude]\n\n\nAmerica is a country of liberty, a meeting of immigrants\nInstead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others\n\n\nSo the major sought a system that used information\nWords to control the subconscious\nIn his eyes, the greatest symbiotic parasite the world's ever known isn't microbial -- it's linguistic\nWords is what keep civilization, our world, alive\n\n[Outro]\n\nIf you are what you say you are, the coolest\nWon't you just shine down?\nYou are what you say you are, the coolest\nWon't you just shine down?\n\n", "summary": "The lyrics depict a story of identity, language, and power.

The hero realizes that the true enemy may lie within oneself, complicating the traditional hero narrative.\n\nThe third verse challenges the idea of heroism even further, suggesting that the hero may actually be perpetuating the cycle of danger and destruction rather than truly saving the day. The hero is confronted with the harsh reality that their actions may be causing more harm than good.\n\nOverall, these lyrics seem to question the traditional notions of heroism and explore the complexities and contradictions that come with being a hero. It challenges the idea of black and white morality and suggests that the line between hero and villain may be more blurred than we think."}

{"title": "DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO\u2019S TETSUO & YOUTH", "lyrics": "--- After listening to Lupe\u2019s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this analysis by getting into the album\u2019s last portion which ran from the season of Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period; I will get into all that later\n--- The season started with \u201cChopper\u201d and a lot of people are wondering why a song like \"Chopper\" is on the album. Well, you can't just get into a song like \"Deliver\" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why \u201cChopper\" is there. It's a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and the gangstas that live in the trap\n--- Moving onto \u201cDeliver,\u201d like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in \u201cChopper\" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, \"Pizza man don\u2019t come here no more,\u201d it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can\u2019t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn\u2019t come there no more, and this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence that is preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza; this all goes back to \u201cChopper\u201d and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn\u2019t come there no more. This one ties into the next song, \u201cMadonna (And other mothers of the hood),\u201d because the piece-of MAN not being there is referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up without them. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so there are significant chances that he\u2019ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations, which will eventually lead to the mother's concern for her child\u2019s well being\n--- With all the information thus far, I think it\u2019s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words is another name for Virgin Mary, who was the mother of Jesus Christ who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus\u2019s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom\u2019s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus\u2019s crucifixion\n--- The next song, \u201cThe Adoration of the Magi,\u201d contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game, and the next song which he appears in, \u201cThey.Resurrect.Over.New.\" This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who are not familiar with The Game's background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, \u201cPut You On Game,\u201d which was rapped primarily from The Game's perspective with lyrics from that song that go, \"I\u2019m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.\u201d This song, \u201cAdoration of the Magi\u201d continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist\u2019s albums that had \nbabies on the covers (Ready to Die, Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.)\n to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering. That\u2019s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it). Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn\u2019t know it; this is why she is wanted by the game, or \u201cadored by the magi.\u201d\n--- Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song\n--- Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it\u2019s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, \u201cWhat if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi?\u201d Here\u2019s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, \"Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus).\" If we look at the phrase from a hood perspective, he is saying, \u201cMadonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstas, drug dealers, killers).\u201d\n--- Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth, then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth\u2019s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like \u201cwe should be closer\u201d and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, \u201cTrapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.\u201d And the only way to get past The Game is to \u201cProceed to the next level\u201d which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, or the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of \nproceeding to the next level\n is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul\u2019s last line, \u201cUnloose the Noose.\u201d That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes\n--- That is about it for the story, but there is still the concept of \nthe seasons\n that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? \nThat was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time\n. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on \nThe Streets\n again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them\n--- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It\u2019s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks\n--- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. \nIf this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece.\n This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. \nLupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever.\n It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, \nthe cycle will never end\n\n---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season\u2019s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS\n\nP.S. \nIf you listen to the album in reverse, it's basically a documentary of Lupe's life thus far and a message for what's to come\n\n", "summary": "The above analysis dives deep into the themes and metaphors present in Lupe Fiasco's album Tetsuo & Youth. The analysis focuses on the last portion of the album, specifically the songs from Winter to Spring, and delves into the religious references, societal issues, and messages that Lupe conveys through his music.\n\nOne major theme that stands out is the examination of the struggles and challenges faced by those living in the hood, particularly the absence of positive role models and the impact of violence on the community. The songs \"Madonna\" and \"Deliver\" touch on the fear and concern that mothers in the hood have for their children, as well as the cycle of violence and crime that perpetuates in these environments.\n\nReligious references, such as the Virgin Mary and the Adoration of the Magi, are used metaphorically to draw parallels between biblical stories and the realities of life in the hood. Lupe cleverly intertwines these religious references with modern-day issues to create a powerful commentary on society and the need for change.\n\nThe analysis also highlights the importance of the youth and the role they play in shaping the future. The songs \"They.Resurrect.Over.New.\" and \"Spring\" emphasize the idea of progressing to the next level and breaking away from the negative influences of the hood. The sound of children playing in the outro signifies a sense of hope and possibility for a better future.\n\nOverall, the analysis provides a comprehensive look at the complex themes and messages woven throughout the album, showcasing Lupe Fiasco's storytelling prowess and thought-provoking lyricism."}

The idea of being a humanitarian superpower instead of a military superpower emphasizes the importance of promoting peace, compassion, and aid rather than violence and domination. Zinn questions the presence of military bases in a hundred countries and suggests that it may actually fuel antagonism and terrorism. This challenges the traditional notion of power and strength being linked to military might. \n\nThe dialogue between the soldiers and the machine can be seen as a metaphor for the destructive and uncontrollable nature of war. The machine, programmed for warfare, is initially seen as a threat but is ultimately reprogrammed by one of the soldiers to promote peace and goodness. This can symbolize the idea that even the most destructive forces can be redirected towards a more positive and humane purpose. It also highlights the power of individual action in challenging and changing systems of violence and oppression.\n\nOverall, these lyrics convey a powerful message about the need to move away from war and aggression towards a more peaceful and humanitarian approach to global issues. They urge us to rethink our priorities and to consider the impact of our actions on others around the world."}

{"title": "Don\u2019t Mess up the Children (Interlude)", "lyrics": "[Interlude: Dr. Nolan Shaw]\nAdults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, \nGod insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up.\n In other words, \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n. African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying \"thank you\" or \"no thank you\" and other forms of common courtesy. \nGod is saying, \"Don't mess up the children\"\n\n", "summary": "The interlude by Dr. Nolan Shaw emphasizes the importance of adults in teaching children cultural values and instilling a sense of respect and courtesy in them. He uses the biblical reference of God instructing adults to talk to their children constantly as a reminder of this responsibility. The phrase \"Don't mess up the children\" serves as a warning against neglecting this duty, which can lead to the erosion of important cultural values within the African American community.\n\nThe interlude touches upon themes of intergenerational transmission of knowledge, the role of adults in shaping the next generation, and the potential consequences of failing to uphold these responsibilities. Metaphorically, the reference to children being driven further apart from their families symbolizes the growing disconnect between generations and the risk of losing important cultural traditions.\n\nOverall, the message conveyed is a call to action for adults to prioritize their role in guiding and nurturing children, ensuring that cultural values and traditions are passed down effectively. The repetition of \"God is saying, 'Don't mess up the children'\" serves as a powerful reminder of the gravity of this responsibility and the potential impact of neglecting it."}

{"title": "Philosophy Sunday (Free Speech)", "lyrics": "[Free Speech Tweets: Lupe Fiasco and Twitter Followers]\n[LP] \nToday's idea for ponder comes from Julian Assange and his intriguing assessment of the impotence of western free speech via economic forces\n\n[LP] He says:\n\n\"The west has fiscalised its basic power relationships through a web of contracts, loans, shareholdings, bank holdings and so on.\"\n[LP] \"In such an environment it's easy 4 speech 2be \"free\" becuz a change in political will rarely leads 2any change in these basic instruments.\"\n[LP] \"Western speech, as something that rarely has any effect on power, is, like badgers and birds, free.\"\n[LP] \"In states like China, there is pervasive censorship, because speech still has power and power is scared of it.\"\n[LP] \"We should always look at censorship as an economic signal that reveals the potential power of speech in that jurisdiction.\"\n\nJulian Assange\n[LP] The core of what he is saying is that the proliferation of free speech inversely represents the lack of effect it has on power structures.\n[LP] The more the speech is \"free\" the less powerful it really is. It is a very radical angle. Any takers?\n\n#PhilosophySunday\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Julian Assange proved in a way that speech is not free.. Not when it comes to the west. Here your speech is mediated... and controlled by those in power. Speech is not truly free when it is corralled under the terms of who it's directed at\n[TW] @LupeFiasco I think Assange is absolutely correct. Speech is very feared, mostly when it's unpopular and free.\n[LP] But what he is inferring is that power does NOT in fact fear \"free\" speech at all. It is \"free\" becuz it is not feared. @CalebFnCool\n[TW] @LupeFiasco occupy wall street was a powerful and dangerous free speech movement that was aimed towards eliminating US capitalism #PS\n[LP] Actually u could say the \"danger\" of OWS was mitigated becuz it was built on the powerless premise of western free speech @kamilahvictoria\n\n[TW] Salman Rushdie is more impactful in India because he is persecuted for his writings. It ironically brings exposure @LupeFiasco #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco i dont think the fact that it's free makes it less powerful, it's the intent and lack of meaning or thought behind it #ps\n[LP] Look at this way. How much to do u truly cherish something that was given to u for free as opposed to a thing u had to pay $$$ for? @cbuddz\n[TW] .@LupeFiasco but the attempt to stifle peaceful protests like Occupy shows the US government is scared of free speech #PS\n[LP] I don't think so. I think it was the OWS aesthetic that was unpleasant to the power structure. Inconvenient but no threat @JordanRaeLake\n[TW] @LupeFiasco can you use his view on free speech when he worked to leak information?\n[LP] I think the reaction to the leaks by the US is because it threatened external relations NOT the internal Western status quos @mullady21\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Free speech, rarely appreciated until it's taken away, most of our generation raised in the U.S. has never experienced this. #PS\n[LP] Does this \"taking away\" lead to a sort of resentment or anger that could possibly empower speech overall? @MIKJAGGA\n[TW] @LupeFiasco Part of this thinking is also derived from the idea that the western world is as good as it gets and can ever be #PS\n[LP] Very interesting @TravisGBTBB\n[TW] @LupeFiasco one could say that America has more of a stranglehold on their people than China does. #PS #Solzhenitsyn\n[LP] Ah the Spector of democratic tyranny... @EvansBranagh\n[TW] @LupeFiasco so our goal is to have a opinion worth silencing? Because being allowed means you and your word has no meaning.\n[LP] It may mean that silence is more powerful that words. As it removes a barometer for the power structure to \"test\" society @AvaryF\n[TW] @AvaryF @lupefiasco I feel even with an opinion worth silencing we're still somehow overshadowed by ignorance\n[LP] \"What they do not know will hurt them\" so to speak Or Biggies line \"Bad Boys move in silence.\" Limit the information accessible @AvaryF\n[TW] @LupeFiasco for example the OWS movement would be incredibly strong now had the power system not given the movement media attention #PS\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco I would argue that Information overload functions as a form of censorship because it is almost impossible to find the truth anyway\n\n[TW] @LupeFiasco speech if everyone had a Bugatti and flaunts it, it goes down in value. speech becomes an materialistic thought in this essence\n[LP] Speech defined as a being a material is very interesting. #ps #twittergold right there @xygoma_\n[TW] @LupeFiasco a politician's speech is not seen as 'powerless'. If people organised themselves better & then spoke, neither would theirs. #PS\n[LP] It can b argued tht a politicians freespeech is the least powerful of all Think of the ambiguity of the \"campaign promise\" @_MudassarRashid\n[LP] And that's #PhilosophySunday for this week. Thanks 2 everyone who chimed in! Shout 2 yall who struck #twittergold . See y'all next week #ps\n\n", "summary": "These tweets by Lupe Fiasco and his Twitter followers delve into the concept of free speech, power structures, and censorship. The discussion revolves around the idea that in the western world, free speech may not actually be as powerful as it seems because it does not often lead to meaningful change in the power dynamics of society. Julian Assange's perspective is highlighted, suggesting that in countries like China where censorship is pervasive, speech is feared because it has the potential to disrupt power.\n\nThe conversation also touches on how the western world may not fully appreciate the value of free speech until it is taken away, and how silence can sometimes be more powerful than words. The comparison between the US and China in terms of control over their people is discussed, as well as the impact of information overload on finding the truth. The discussion also delves into how speech can lose value when it becomes materialistic, akin to everyone having a luxury car and flaunting it.\n\nOverall, these tweets prompt reflection on the complexities of free speech, power, and censorship in society, raising important questions about the true impact and value of speech in various contexts."}

The repeated mention of FnF (Fahrenheit and 1st & 15th Entertainment) suggests a sense of camaraderie and loyalty to his team.

Lupe Fiasco raps about being confident in his abilities and differentiating himself from other artists who rely on generic themes like drugs and violence in their music. He encourages the listener to open their eyes, imagine, and expand their horizons through music and artistry.\n\nThe mention of John Lennon Chucks and Independent Trucks could be seen as metaphorical references to individualism and independence in the face of conformity. The line about dust could represent a sense of humility or a reminder to stay grounded despite success.\n\nThe hook from Gorillaz asks if we are the last living souls, which could suggest a sense of existential questioning or a search for meaning and purpose. The reference to Fahrenheit 1/15 Part III could signify a continuation or evolution of the artist's previous work, perhaps symbolizing growth and progression in his artistry.\n\nOverall, the lyrics encourage the listener to think critically, be creative, and stay true to themselves in a world where many conform to conventional norms."}

The protagonist, Teriyaki Joe, travels to an upscale location, contrasting the squalor of his taxi cab with the luxury of Central Park. The description of the Moon being only a meter thick and the sensory disconnect during transportation allude to a world that is artificial and controlled.\n\nThe character of 11, who represents the devil or antagonist in the story, symbolizes the deceptiveness and manipulation in this high-tech society.

We call it the basement\n\nUnderneath that in no particular order is Old London, Sau Paulo, what's left of Los Angeles & Moscow and that's pretty much it\n\n\nCity states stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob.\n Earth decided to a go a little nuts orbitally speaking.\n\nScientist still can't explain it. But in short Earth began spinning out of control &. what wasn't literally thrown into space was BBQ'd off.\n\nSome say that's it all a conspiracy and were actually living inside some science project out in the middle of the desert & \nnothing is real.\n\n\nEither way here we are. The cities or at least the parts that were able survive the tumult & the apocalyptic meltdown that followed...\n\n..signed treaties and created \n\"The Caste\" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.\n\n\nThe rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.\n\n\nEverything else, \nreligion,\n philosophy, crime, etc just kind gets in where it fits in. Not lawless but definitely \"law-least.\" Why not?\n\nWhen the very Earth you live on takes an unexpected shit on you & your way of life everything kinda goes out of focus. Welcome to the blur.\n\n\nThe position of the real Sun over Central Park hasn't changed in about 100 years.\n If it wasn't 4 the Nano-Gravy it would've been burned away.\n\nIt's literally the tip of the iceberg. Gotta be \"born\" there to live there kinda jazz. An Invitation only Taichi party for the fancy tyrant.\n\nIt's ultra-simplistic in form. Just grass, the glass buildings and the all encompassing Gravy. \nNo history, no future. Just never-ending now.\n\n\nNo pressures, no sympathies. Just calm and nihilism. Hence why 11's request, I mean threat, to bring his daughter back is so out of order.\n\nDown here in Neo-Harlem it's none of that. It's all about maximum consumption all the time. Crime & nostalgia & love & hate.\n\nLiving like no tomorrow was yesterday. Like the end of the world came and left us behind like bastards on the steps of an abandoned church.\n\nLuckily ppl still want2 find things so that keeps me employed. Luckily 4 them Im really good @ it but maybe not so lucky 4 me this time tho.\n\nI spent the night pondering my next few moves. I knew I needed a Mambo Queen and that meant going Downstairs to Neo- Orleans.\n\nFor obvious reasons I'll need a disguise. And a guide who knows her way around...\nan Eve to lead Adam to the Apple tree.\n \nAn Eve indeed!\n\n\n---End Of Chapter 5---\n\n#TJNHD\n\n", "summary": "The above passage from Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective explores themes of class division, survival, nihilism, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world. The concept of cities stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob symbolizes the stratification of society, with the rich and powerful residing at the top and the less fortunate at the bottom. The idea of Earth spinning out of control and cities facing apocalyptic events reflects the uncertainty and instability of the world in which the characters live.\n\nThe contrast between Central Park, with its luxury and comfort, and Neo-Harlem, with its gritty and chaotic nature, highlights the disparities in wealth and privilege. The mention of Nano-Gravy, a substance that protects Central Park from the harsh elements, symbolizes the artificiality and detachment from reality that the elite may experience.\n\nThe protagonist, Teriyaki Joe, navigating this harsh world and seeking a guide in Neo-Orleans represents the search for guidance and purpose in a world where everything seems out of control. The reference to Eve leading Adam to the Apple tree suggests a quest for knowledge and truth, even if it comes with consequences.\n\nOverall, the passage conveys a sense of disorientation, uncertainty, and the struggle to find meaning and direction in a chaotic and divided society."}

I fell for the Mohawk. She fell for the 10,000 Units. The business of love in the streets\n\n\nHad to relieve some tension before I made my first move. Decisions made while being tense always come back to bite you in the ass. Clarity\n\n\n\"Everybody\" just for 1 person. Seems a bit extreme.\n Even for a \"Parker.\" \nYou'd think all that Taichi would make them a little more peaceful\n\n\nA little more humane. Hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point.\n This whole thing has funk on it\n\nI know 11 was serious though. Deadly serious. \nSerious as the 100 Million Units he winked at me when I refused to take the job\n\nSerious when he said in 5 days he'd \"update\" every food pill in Neo-Harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;)\n\nGet rich and save Neo-Harlem. I like that.  Getting lost in the VooDoo and probably end up destroying Neo-Harlem anyway. I don't like that\n\n\nThings tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. I got both. Mix fear with reward. I'm impressed\n\n\nLost dogs are easy. Easy as pie. Find some shabby two-Unit witch doctor have him call some flea bag back from the VooDoo, Exorcise & Upload\n\n\nGetting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. Not pie at all. Devils pie is what it is\n\nShit!\n\n\n---End Of Chapter 4---\n\n", "summary": "The lyrics in this chapter of \"Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective\" seem to revolve around themes of love, tension, decision-making, loyalty, and danger. The protagonist, Teriyaki Joe, is faced with a challenging decision that could have dire consequences for Neo-Harlem. He is caught between the potential reward of money and the fear of what could happen if he accepts a dangerous job. The reference to \"pie\" could symbolize something that appears simple or easy on the surface, but is actually quite complex and difficult.\n\nThe mention of Valentine's Day and love in the streets suggests a contrast between the personal and professional aspects of Joe's life. The tension and fear he feels indicate the high stakes of his actions, as well as the pressure he is under to make the right choices.\n\nThe mention of a \"shabby two-Unit witch doctor\" and \"VooDoo\" implies a sense of mysticism and supernatural elements in this futuristic world. The idea of bringing a human soul back from the afterlife adds a layer of complexity to Joe's already difficult situation.\n\nOverall, these lyrics convey a sense of urgency, moral ambiguity, and the struggle between personal gain and the greater good. The use of metaphors and vivid imagery helps to paint a vivid picture of Neo-Harlem and Joe's internal conflict."}

The mention of comedians like George Carlin and Dave Chappelle highlights the power of using comedy as a tool to challenge societal norms and speak truth to power. The comparison to \"yo mama\" jokes and heckler interactions suggests a shift towards more surface-level humor that may not necessarily provoke deeper thinking.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on the idea of comedians using comedy to expose and address darker truths and ignorance in society. The reference to Eddie Griffin appeals to the idea that comedy can serve as a vehicle for discussing difficult or controversial topics in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n\nOverall, the lyrics lament the potential that is being wasted in comedy, with the speaker expressing a desire for comedians to take their craft more seriously and use their platform to make a positive impact."}

{"title": "Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Take on Drake v. Meek Mill", "lyrics": "The Haunting\n\nA Letter\n\n\nTo rappers from a rapper\n...simply write your own rhymes as much as you can if you are able. \nGhostwriting, or borrowing lines, or taking suggestions from the room has always been in rap and will always be in rap.\n It is nothing to go crazy over or be offended about unless you are someone who postures him or herself on the importance of authenticity and tries to portray that quality to your fans or the public at large. Then we might have a problem. \nSome of the most pivotal moments in rap have been ghostwritten verses.\n This leads to a bigger point. Rapping is not an easy thing to do. It's takes years of work and trial and error to master some of its finer points. Respect from other MC's comes in many formats. Sales, live performances, realness etc but the one thing that is the most important is the raps themselves at least in the eyes of other serious rappers. The phrase \"I'm not a rapper\" gets thrown around as if it's a badge of honor. And that's fine. If rap is a side hustle for you or just a come up then by all means may the force be with you. But I know a lot of MC's where rap is the first love and the first thing they think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about when they go to sleep. Rappers who pursue the art form with this level of intention may not become rich and famous off selling their raps to a wide audience but that has never been an accepted metric to begin with in terms of quality or level of skill. The vast majority of rappers will never sell 100 records in their lifetimes let alone millions. But that's not the point, the point is that what pursuing the craft gives us in terms of the intangibles is something that record sales or fame could never represent. We achieve a mastery of language and poetics that competes on the highest levels of discourse across the entirety of human history. We express ourselves creatively and attain a sense of liberation and self-esteem via this sacred mode of creation and communication\n\n\nModern Radio and the commercial realm of music has injured rap. \nIt set up ambiguous rules and systems for success that don't take into consideration the quality and skill of the rappers craft.\n It redefined rap as just being a beat driven hook with some words in between and an entire generation has surrendered to chasing the format instead of chasing the art form. While mastering any format should be the pursuit of any self-respecting rapper including the commercial format it must be kept clear that it is just one of many formats and that you should strive to master all of them. The art form is kept alive and progressive in the activities of the tens of thousands of rappers around the world who are everyday trying to think of that next witty bar. Trying to put that crazy verse together while at work. Trying to find that word that rhymes with catapult so they can finish off that vivid story rap about their childhood. Meek Mill struck a nerve accusing Drake of having a ghostwriter and the entire rap world reacted on all sides of the fence because rap is alive. It's active and it feels. Its rules and traditions are vibrant and responsive. I enjoy both these brothers music and find inspiration and appreciation from both of them. I remember being in Toronto at Goodfoot years ago and it was a stack of CD's on the counter and the guy behind the counter was like \"Lupe you gotta take this CD. It's my mans mixtape.\" I didn't really pay it any mind I took it to the car and looked it over and just kind of set it aside focused on other things. I vividly remember saying \"what kind of rap name is Drake?\" The rest is history. Once while in Philly I went to do an interview in a shabby and very hood basement studio complex. I peeked into one of the rooms and it was this tall kid with his shirt off bouncing up and down in the booth with an energy that was electric. I gave him my regards. He gave them back. I think I mentioned something about him cutting his dreads. As I left I remember him rapping something about being a boss. The rest is history. At the end of the day, for better or worse, rap is alive even if some of its greatest moments are written by ghosts\n\n", "summary": "The letter is written by a rapper addressing other rappers about the issue of ghostwriting in rap music.

{"title": "Dear White Supremacy", "lyrics": "Dear White Supremacy,\n\nFirst of all you are not really that supreme. \nWhile throughout history White Supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions.\n \nThese positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. I mean and anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox\n. \nNot judging, just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks aren't immune to because they've never seen it doesn't make you strategically smart or tactically superior, just kind of sick.\n \nAnd these dominant positions don't really stand up to the test of time that long either.\n There is nothing about you biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy. For that matter there is also nothing about you psychologically, philosophically, cognitively, academically, socially, architecturally, culturally or even financially that signifies a higher position above any other group. \nAnd to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well. So what you really are is something in the middle. You are regular. White Regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. Black, Brown, Etc etc. But in regularity there is room for differences and this is where White Regularity shines! Each group gets the same essential universals. Dance, food, music, etc. and it must be admitted that the White Regularity take on these universal institutions has been unbelievably impressive and a great addition to the total world culture\n. \nI mean spaghetti and meatballs, Romeo & Juliet, Coldplay, The Tuxedo, lighter than air travel are all world class additions to the collective bucket\n but they are no less or more impressive than every other regular groups take on the universals either. \nAnd if we really wanted to get analytical every invention is built on inspiration from a previously existing invention\n so the claim of \"The Supreme 1st\" to do something is highly debatable and except for a few exceptions, impossible! All things human aren't born from a supreme overlord solely working in isolation.\nThings are created in collaboration and in tandem with other cultures, knowledge structures and movements and more important, People. I mean if those Muslims didn't catalog all that Greek philosophy for research we might not even know who Plato was\n. Now whether this collaboration is forced which is seen so much but not exclusively throughout human history does not take away the fact that it is done with the help of somebody else. \nWe are supreme as a spectrum of colors in collaboration. One color does not dominate the other nor can it. Sure Steve Jobs was white. But the guy who built the computer was probably Chinese. And the girl who wrote the programs for the computer is probably from Mumbai. And the raw materials that were used to make it where probably first pulled out of the ground by somebody in South Africa.\n And if you take this highly collaborated upon piece of high technology to an indigenous tribe in the jungles of Brazil they'd probably use it as a boat paddle. And we can go on and on down or up the rabbit hole all day long and you'll always find a regular somebody relying on the abilities of a just as regular somebody else that another regular somebody doesn't even care about. White Supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it. \nHere's the bad news, ain't no top. Here's the good news though, ain't no bottom neither!\n \nIt's just the regular ole middle where nobody is safe from being influenced by somebody else's extreme regularness.\n Is your swastika flag printed in Mexico? \nDid you know the swastika is officially from Asia and the subcontinent?\n \nDid you know black people had slaves in Africa too?\n \nDid you know in the world your considered a minority too?\n \nI mean you call us niggers and beaners but you gotta ship all your former Native American land backwood sourced ginseng to China to get money to support your meth habit\n. Meth that's made with chemicals produced in India. I mean Hitler hated everything about the Jews expect every possession they had. It's funny how the things you hate so much you have to rely on the most for your survival.\nAnd if you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it, White Supremacy has to validate it's on identity based solely on its relationship to other races! I mean now that's what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to supreme over! That sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid.\n \nStupid like a fox. And no not stupid like a Fox News I mean the real fox. The animal.\n\nIn closing white regularity (the race formerly know as white supremacy) I myself on behalf of my own black regularity salute you. Good luck with the northwest front I hear it's beautiful in the spring and probably a strategic death trap if and when \nYellowstone finally decides to blow up!\n\nYours Truly\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The above lyrics are a powerful critique of White Supremacy and the idea of racial hierarchy.

Lol\n\nSo let's get this started. I (as Wasalu Jaco) started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious\n#PS\n\nI found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea I was trying to express. Layers of meaning. #PS\n\nStory of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums I will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #PS\n\nLet's have a look at the painting and the cover #PS\nThe name of the painting is in Italian \"Uomo Mangiato Tigre\" and ROUGHLY translates as \"Man Eating Tiger\" #PS\n\nSo let's start there. What is your interpretation of the title \"Man Eating Tiger\"?\nRemember to tag responses with #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco does the \"man eating tiger\" have any reflection of the issues with you as an artist (man) and your label Atl Rec (Tiger)? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco internal struggle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco natures life cycle #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I feel like the meaning behind it may deal more so with how you say it not what you're saying. #PS\n\nAh! Some very early #TwitterGold from @SpeightSZN\nCare to explain what you mean by \"how you say it\"\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man desires to become part of society and in turn consumes himself #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Man conquering what would be considered a dangerous animal #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco human contamination of something more vicious than it #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man becoming more ferocious then the tiger, almost like a David Vs. Goliath also #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Reversals--wildness tamed and consumed. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco chaos #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Man is the top but sometimes we behave like animals..although we say we are superior thus man eating(becoming) Tiger. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco because you can look at the phrase \"man eating tiger\" in two different ways. It's like a double entendre of a title. #PS\n\nAh some #TwitterGold from @jjLawson_\nSo it has two meanings?\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man destruction against the last majestic and natural strengths of our world. #PS\n\nRT: @SpeightSZN @LupeFiasco Like a play on words. The tiger has gotten a taste for human blood? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the definition I see from it stems back to Tigers being pouched by man. So eating man means self preservation and survival #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the response lines up w the islamic interpretation of the tiger representing money profits & honor which would be Atlantic #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco struggle to survive, Man eating tiger vs Man-Eating tiger #PS\n\nGreat stuff...so yes the title can be read as two ways...let's expand a little bit on that. Who is the man and who is the tiger?\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The man being the normal man and the tiger being society itself #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the man is a anyone and the tiger is society #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco that is up for you to decide... You can chose to be one or the other. Or can you be both? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco maybe the man and the tiger are one....this could all be about self destruction if that were the case #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco it can be any David/Goliath situation. Western media against the Muslim Faith comes to mind. But it's open to a lot #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco if I follow-up what I said about red (the tiger) symbolizing carnal tones, the tiger engulfs the skull (the man) with rage #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Truly depends, everyone posses both characters.  #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco One in the same. #ps We're animals, like tigers, but also, there's a 'tiger'. Whats the tiger though? Lol #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The man = people in power, keeping you, as the tiger, contained and essentially eating the life and inspiration from you #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the man is the industry, the tiger is the artist. the industry poaches artists for their talents. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco well \"the man\" has always been the guy in charge, and we are all animals so you're the tiger? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco it depends on the situation; for example, man could be the Average Joe, and his tiger could be the daily grind of a 9-to-5 #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco depends on who is saying it; everyone can say they're the man/ tiger when its convenient #PS\n\nAh very interesting #Twittergold . The changing of identities. Adaptation or masquerading?@gvanx\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The tiger is the government and the man is the \"taxpayer\". Nobody really knows who controls who. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco why shouldn't we be the tiger fighting internally and man could be society in a conceptualized collective perspective #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man is the people, tiger is the current establishment in the concrete jungle #PS\n\nVery great stuff! You guys could be tour guides at the Prado!\nLet's shift to the other word in the title: \"Eating.\"\nThoughts? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating what? Who's eating? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco engulfing, overwhelming, controlling #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco whats the meal #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating is control. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco being swallowed by its environment #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Eating could refer to a conflict between the \"man\" inside us and the \"tiger\".. civilized vs instincts\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco captivity of negativity #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating could mean conquering... #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating can be synonymous with greed. Double burger with cheese.....#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco consumption of morality #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I look at eating as a pleasure & I see the two entities (man or tiger) finding pleasure in getting rid of the other. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Eating could mean conquering or destroying #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco trying to be controlled #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco consuming and profiting at the expensive of the victim #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating as in destroying the tigers habitat #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Eating could mean the tiger is taking your life away, or your rights #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Killing/eating your inner artist. Making you discouraged to pursue and keep producing your art. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco It can be consuming sustenance, a necessity for survival, or gluttony, succumbing to desire. #PS\n\nFun Fact: I don't use the whole title when I talk about this painting with friends. I just call it \"The Mangiato\" or \"The Eating\"\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The eating is still in process. Eternal consumption. Consumerism?  #PS\n\nAh some professional #Twittergold from @wirelessphi\nA continuum of consumption? How? Please expand for us...\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Eating symbolizes survival #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco any form of consumption, be it eat, indulge, be taken over by, etc. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco \"Drinking the Koolaid\" Taking everything in; Gullible You are what you eat. #PS\n\nAh #TwitterGold from @mickystweeting\nI never looked at it that way. \"You are what you eat\" so the tiger picks up human traits?\n#PS\n\nRT: Eating can symbolize reward. The man (you) is being rewarded through all the challenges Atlantic (tiger) put you through. #PS @LupeFiasco\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco In this case eating = exploitation? #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco tiger = bourgeoisie, man= proletariat, both in never-ending contest. the purple looks like a scab, the wounds from revolt #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco eating doesn't necessarily mean that the other doesn't exist anymore. Can it refer to become one? #PS\n\nAh! #TwitterGold from @heyhappymonday\nSo this painting isn't a violent scene of consumption? It's something softer?\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Man consumes but is consumed by his consumption. Can't escape the cycle--always needs fiercer tigers to keep him entertained #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco it's all about perspective, we could pick up the Tigers traits. Savage, \"regressive\" behavior is omnipresent.. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco never ending consumption. An indulgent of some sort, probably along the lines of obsession or addiction. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco #ps \"Man Eating Tiger\"\nMan. Eating. Tiger.\nMan, eating tiger.\nMan=eating tiger.\nMan eating=tiger.\n\nGreat way to put it  in an equation form #Twittergold from @drownsomebody82\nFun Fact: there is a lot of math used in Philosophy\n#PS\n\nLet's move away from the title and look at the painting itself. What do u see? What is what?\n#PS\nRT: @LupeFiasco a skull, most likely representing man #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I see bars and sculls #PS\n\n\u201c@WWJRHRD: @LupeFiasco why the frame?\u201d\nFor fanciness...lol #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco for one I can see that the red skull might symbolize violence #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Self contained...straight lines...the skull is the only thing that deviates #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Those 2 brush strokes remind me of a tiger ripping through the man (or vice versa) #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I see the red from the skull and the red and purple line are parallel could this be stating they connect with each other? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco colors of a tiger and a human skull #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco #PS\nRT: @LupeFiasco I see fresh death which is covered in red an also a blue streak an we know only sonic is fast enough to make that streak #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the skull is fading away. Beinf destroyed by this red shape as an all consuming rage?\n\nLemme help yall out a little: there is a man, a tiger, flesh, blood, bone and my two favorites..a soul & technology!\nSee Them now?\n#PS\n\nThere is also some brain in there...grey matter\nsee it?\n#PS\n\nRT: @lupefiasco Purple=Wounds, , brown and red=blood trail, pink=loss of innocence, white=innocence,beginnings, tan=guilt...red, skull=death #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I see the tiger being hidden away in the background, the man is trying to consume and cover the tiger but can't completely #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The soul may be the blue stripe? #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco The lines in the art in different angles convey how \"eating the tiger\" isn't straight forward, it's complex, difficult. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Having a soul, and ability to create technology, separates us from the animal instinct/thirst for blood. #PS\n\n\u201c@yellow_arigo35: @LupeFiasco where is the technology? #PS\u201d\nThe Silver color field in the upper left\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco duality of man?

With the brain  and tech, man manages to become a danger to the highest in the food chain  #ps\n\nWooh! Some #Twittergold from @mrbrpeters\nBut when man enters nature without all the technological superiority...???\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco I feel like you are trying to say that we are becoming over-dependant on technology therefore not using our brains that much #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco @mrbrpeters he's at the mercy of nature #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco but man is the most adaptable animal, entering the wilderness without technology does not preclude him from creating it. #PS\n\nGreat stuff...let's wrap it up...\nFinal Thoughts on \"Uomo Mangiato Tigre\" or \"The Eating\" as I like to call it...\n#PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco It feels like epiphenomenalism, the duality between mind & body & technology's affect on it. The tiger symbolizes our instinct.\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man must stay focused and not let society (the tiger) alter their thoughts and break them down #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Humans are ruining them self #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco nothing is as evil as we see it to be. It's all perspective. Everything is trying to find their own place in this world. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco man and tiger in a constant battle over who is the superior predator. #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco Man is oppresses the tiger because of technology, but without it, the tiger wins out.\nMan-eating tiger\nMan eating tiger #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco \"eating\" is living life good from bad decisions (drug dealing) until tiger (police) takes your life and locks you in a cage #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco \"uomo Mangiato Tigre\" is life today as we know it. And we need to appreciate ourselves more then materials #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco the painting's meaning as a whole to me is a man trying to hide corruption (the tiger, tech) but there is still hope (pink) #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco lets just call it mans battle with the world and nature in his eternal bid to understand himself. #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco it further adds to the bigger discussion that'll be expanded in ur LP, so like a quintuple entendre.. Art, tracklist, songs #ps\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco we are depending more on technolgy than our brians!! #PS\n\nRT: @LupeFiasco how bout technology being  the tiger that's eating the man.

I see a tiger descending into the body of a man, being consumed. You see the inside of man\n\nBut I also see a tiger in the process of ripping a man to pieces.

{"title": "Meditations On A New Diasporic Mythology Complex", "lyrics": "I think as we begin to think about myth, mythology, and the need of mythology - I was basically raised on mythology, introduced to mythology at a very young age. \nMostly Greek mythology, and of course of that Roman mythology, which kinda took over what the Greeks left off, and kinda super-imposed themselves on a lotta the Greek myths - very directly  in the form of Hercules, and the -cules.\n And that was the kind of literature I was reading as an adolescent, which became my first kind of education into creation of stories, creation of myths, and it was the role of myth being used to establish certain principles and certain narratives and certain answering of questions why in a very fantastic manner and a very supernatural manner, in that sense. But in some capacities, even a very natural manner.\n\nAnd so, once you're steeped into kinda that education; that formation; you start to think in those capacities, you start to develop your world views and your outlooks based on those kind of templates, those creation templates. As you think of, you know, that's one aspect, and you start to think of those conscious aspects consciously being attended to, and researching, and being entertained by certain narratives, mythical narrates from a certain period. And then you think of the unconscious narratives, and even you think of modern narratives, which are kind of fast-forwarded through time and the narratives which you are introduced to consciously of a more modern kind of piece: the mythology of America, the mythology of globalization, the mythology of - you know, as it stands. A myth kind of being steeped into a certain misunderstanding, and then trying to achieve the understanding reconcile of your ignorance to a certain degree through this template, this mythical template, which lays everything plain and gives you the A plus B equals C and you go on and live your life, all things are well.\n\nBut say you think of the modern mythologies, the mythology of the cowboy, the mythology of the gangsta, the mythology of just these supernatural beings - maybe not as supernatural as Zeus, of course, or Hercules, of course - but still bearing the same, some of the same fascinations with the fantastic. And these great abilities and these grand possessions and levels of influence and power, which are steeps, and the ability to influence specifically, the ability to influence discourse, the ability to influence progressions of ideas, the ability to influence women into the bed, the ability to gather large, vast quantities of material possessions, and not only have them, but to have a disdain for them; to be so above it all, once you have it where these things, where there's a certain aesthetic nature to it, that when you've consumed all of these things and at the same time you have the power to relinquish them, to show that they have no value and the way that you treat to them.\n\nAnd it's very interesting to classify that as mythology, if you know not of it, if you can't see it first-hand, if you don't really have your own creation-kind-of story as to why things are a certain revealed - it has been revealed to you that this is the way it works, these are the mechanics to this particular situation - you're gonna, in my capacity, you're gonna develop it and through myth, through your interaction with myth, through your self-creation of myth.\n\nAnd so there's a role of mythology. And I think persuing that role and taking on the role of the author of mythology. Even in the circumstance that what you are, this modern, this real -  let's call it this reality, to, you know, translate it into mythology, to regress it back into mythological kind of structure, it opens up new terrain, it opens up new frontiers for expedition: for literary expedition, for critical expedition, for poetic expedition, and from political expedition, from social expedition; and even from a historical expedition, because the nature of mythology is that it is steeped in a misunderstanding - and that misunderstanding never really becomes reconciled. It still exists, this mythology, post-misunderstanding, is really an attempt, a version, one vein in an attempt to explain or to reconcile this misunderstanding. But in it, it in itself is not a reconciliation. Reconciliation is still needed at the base, and that's why we have things like science, and different things which act upon it with all of its philosophies and its experiments and theories to try to achieve the reconciliation of the primary misunderstandings about things. Well, no matter what they are: naturals, the perceived supernaturals, the subnatural, et cetera et cetera...\n\nBut there's license. There's license to do as you will, to do as you see fit, to do that, to retain the authorial dimension of saying, \"I am going to author mythology, the new mythology - and in this particular instance, the mythology of the diaspora - so, diasporian mythology.\" Within a modern context looking backwards towards history and not in the attempt, which I think is a new way of looking at it, not in an attempt to reconcile the totality of society to this point, but more to - or I guess that is the question. What is it? Because the attempt isn't to reconcile, I mean you're not trying to reconcile a misunderstanding of what you tryin' to do. Are you just trying to promote? Or are you just trying to point attention towards the misunderstanding? But even within this, there is a reality: It's not just mythology, it is an understanding, and that might be it. It's not that it's a misunderstanding which gives birth to myth. It is a understanding, it is already reconciled, it is already consolidated, it is already real. And but from that reality it births mythology, which kinda turns things on our heads a bit, I think. Alright. DROGAS.\n\n", "summary": "The above text delves into the concept of mythology and its role in shaping our understanding of the world.

{"title": "The Police: A Letter", "lyrics": "A Letter\n\nThe police are not your friend. The police are not your enemy. The same could be said about the law. So let's say it. The law is not your friend and the law is not your enemy. So what are the police then if they are not friends nor enemies. Well let's get a definition of the word 'Police' from the dictionary: \"the civil force of a national or local government, responsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order.\" And while we're at it lets get a dictionary definition of 'Law' as well: \"the system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties.\" Nowhere in the definition does it say \"friend\" or \"enemy\" even though some police officers can be friendly and some can be really antagonistic (see the famed \"Good Cop/Bad Cop\" routine for an explicit example) it is not the nature of their position in society to be friend or foe. So what are the police then? The firmest designation for the police is their primary title \"Law Enforcement Officer\" and again the law is neither your friend or foe so then the police are a merely reflection of the law. Police are the physical manifestation of the law. The police occupy a middle ground of sorts. They are mostly benign in the sense that if they have no particular law to enforce then they are powerless. Also where the law is broken and can't be seen or is out of the conscious knowledge of the police they are also powerless as is the law itself. Law is only powerful when it comes into direct contact with its child, Criminality. Crime and our relationship to crime is much closer to us than our relationship to the law. Everybody bends or breaks the law in some very minute capacity. We may speed on the highway from time to time. Throw litter on the ground. Lie on our taxes. Disregard a jury duty summons. Download pirated content. Where we feel the law doesn't \"count\" or \"make sense\" we are inclined to transgress the limits. Furthermore Crime is celebrated in all annals of entertainment and culture. In movies and books and song and TV. When was the last time you heard a song on the radio about the fabulous and sexy lifestyles of being a cop? In movies and TV it is much different as police officers are portrayed as being heroic figures but how many times within those same films or TV shows a police officer goes \"outside\" the law to rectify some injustice or solve some crime. How many movie cops had to \"give up their badge\" to the captain because they broke the rules to catch the bad guy? In effect they had to become criminals to enforce to the law. Think of Batman. Commissioner Gordon uses him when things get a little too out of hand in Gotham City and he needs somebody who isn't bound to the letter of the law and all that that entails to deal with the villainous hordes. This maybe \"fictional\" but then again is it really? How many real life cops put guns and drugs on people to get an arrest possibly on people who they know for a fact are committing serious crimes but can't prove it? How many cops \"invent\" a probable cause to effect a search of someone's property and eventually \"find what they were looking for\" even though what they found was not the initial reason they stopped the person? How many cops beat confessions out of people? How many cops flat out lie when it comes to what they saw or did during arrests and follow up investigations? How many cops have used terroristic threats to get people to comply to testifying or admitting to things they didn't commit? How many cops work for the same criminals they are employed to pursue in the forms of bribes and information? But then how many citizens do the same exact things? \"Police Officer\" and \"Law Enforcement Officer\" are just titles, roles, positions, names. No different than \"typewriter\" or \"car.\" What gives these things life are the people that use them. Some people just do not know how to type or drive and it must be said that some people just don't know how to be police officers in strict accordance with the law. One problem is that becoming a police officer or law enforcement officer is a very structured and ordered bureaucratic process. It is very rigid and rather systematic. It is literally uniformed to stand as the visible and physical counterpoint to the non-uniformed wildness that is on the one smaller end, society itself and on the other larger end, criminality. Crime is subtle and blends well into the wild variety of society. Crime is successful because it is asymmetric and forever evolving. It can go unnoticed. Hence why the most successful police operations are done \"undercover\" and the most visible criminal activities are the least successful. The ability to blend into the \"wildness\" of society and mimic it is the best tactic for success outside of pure anarchy. Crime is highly adaptable. It is highly revered because its heroes have excellent leadership qualities and in some cases very deep philanthropic sentiments. Crime is the true equal opportunity employer and is one of the only organizations to successfully overcome the racial divides. Criminals are the embodiment of the material American Dream. Freedom (even from taxation!), upward mobility and the pursuit of happiness. All crimes have victims but one could say quite successfully that all things have victims. In the business world, victims are classified under the term externalities. For example, some people call perfectly legal mountain top removal coal mining a crime against humanity as it has the potential to build up then completely destroy entire communities not to mention the sometimes irreversible environmental externalities. Laws sometimes have a weird way of creating their own criminal enemies, hence the \"child\" term used earlier. Take for instance prohibition, it was a perfectly sound moral concept to combat what was seen by some as the scourge of drunkenness and all its hideous social and moral externalities, just imagine drunk driving back in the 20's! This perfectly sound moral law however single handedly created the mafia, the worlds greatest and most successful organized criminal enterprise. The emergence of the mafia lead to the creation of the FBI which was needed to be a \"higher\" form of law enforcement to combat the mob. The FBI tactics included all sorts of law bending and law creation to try and successfully tackle the problem the same government that employed them unwittingly created in the first place. The cultural impact of the mafia was instantaneous and deep even up to this day. For example, we all know off top who Al Capone was but would struggle to find out who the president of the United States was during the time Al Capone was alive. And without Google today I'd say some of us would probably never know or even care to find out. The legal limits were stretched to the fight the mafia then and they are still being stretched to this day to justify your parking ticket or your \"failure to signal.\" So what does all this mean? Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Is there a solution? Unfortunately and fortunately there is no one solution. Law enforcement and criminality are like hand and glove. They are forever connected and as long as you have one you'll have the other and all the externalities from both sides that come along with them. Abuse of authority by authority will be balanced somewhere on the other side by abuse of the system by criminality. Freddy Grey dies unjustly in police custody on one side and El Chapo escapes from prison on the other side. An eye for and eye to be biblical about it. One hard solution to swallow for many is to just obey the law. Buuuuuut this \"simple\" solution also can create a set of dubious illegitimate children of its own because the law inextricably represents much more than its face value of \"do not do and you will not be punished\" for some \"obey\" is equated to \"starve\" or \"go without\" or \"be poor\" or \"be insulted\" or \"be bored\" or \"be trapped in a vicious circle of economic and academically induced depression simply because I lost the biological lottery of life and was born into a family of second or third class citizens at a time and place where social status is dictated by race which also dictates access to the apparatuses of upward mobility etc etc etc...\" Sometimes \"obey\" explicitly means die. This is the root of the plague of vendetta that is sweeping through Chicago. The ever viral and ever rational and true \"Kill Or Be Killed\" mentality. For some \"obey\" MEANS \"punishment.\" This misunderstanding of metaphorical process when it comes to how we refer, frame and live through the narratives of our individual lives is what causes much of the conflict. Objective law has little wiggle room for subjective reality. What \"law enforcement officer\" means in a dictionary and the courts can be far from the definition that it has on the streets and in practice. Police officers can be defined on the streets as surely protecting and serving but protecting and serving the wills of a corrupt authoritative system that if allowed to have its way will mean poverty forever and access denied ad infinitum. Police officers must be trained to assess not only the dangers of a situation but also the desperation of a situation. Is it just a coincidence that a synonym for criminal is \"Desperado\"? Law Enforcement has to become much more in tune and educated with the needs (material, PSYCHOLOGICAL, spiritual and cognitive) of the communities it is tasked with patrolling and if they are unable or unwilling to take on the entire scope of their position then they should find work elsewhere. Most police will respond to this by saying that such a comprehensive approach is not in there job description and will have little to no effect on the streets. One must then in reply confront them with the nature of law itself. Law is connected to the mentalities of man. It seeks to control or less invasively patrol the passions and actions of man which stem directly from his mind. And if you cannot fully comprehend the mind of a man as an externality of the environment in which he inhabits then how can you fully understand the mechanics of law itself? Again Law and the mind are like hand and glove. Some cops will say that it is for the courts to decide. However, one must argue back plainly that judges, prison guards and prosecutors don't walk the streets or patrol the beats and they rely on and TRUST police officers and their presupposed understanding of the law to bring cases before them that only meet or exceed the requirements set out by the law. That is why POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT because they are considered to be expert witnesses in terms of criminal justice and are expected to expose the very fine details of active criminality that a DA stuck in an office or a judge stuck behind a bench does not have the time nor mental hard drive space to process thoroughly. Be clear on two things: This is not meant to be a belittling or a rebuke of the police or the letter and spirit of the law. I have 3 siblings with long careers in law enforcement as police officers, correctional officers and sheriffs. This is also not an approval of criminality. I have exponentially many more family and friend who have been involved in the world of crime and it is nothing to brag about or applaud as a successful life to lead. Most of the time it has ended in death or prison or both. Both these institutions are reflections of the human condition and our understandings and misunderstandings of the way the world is \"supposed\" to work. The death of Sandra Bland is the perfect example of when these two amorphous and wandering institutions get it all the way wrong. Sandra perceived the law enforcement officer to be a law enforcement officer and all that that entails in control of his emotions and strictly subservient to the rule of law when in fact he retreated to criminality and reverted to lawlessness to prosecute what he perceived to be a disrespectful criminal threat in Sandra as opposed to her being a law abiding but pressurized citizen questioning the lawfulness of her stop. Her death in jail is a reflection of the misunderstanding of the mental pressure even the tiniest amount of perceived injustice can do to a person. While I hesitate to judge her cause of death I feel comfortable in saying that if it was suicide it speaks to the depth of the belief we as humans have in right and wrong. Sometimes people would rather die than face the injustices of this world and it doesn't need to be years or decades to decay someone to such a state it can take hours or days. Even seconds. The direct connection between The Law and The Mind is something that needs to taken very seriously by not only police officers but also by the rank and file citizen. The FULL scope of Law and Law Enforcement and Criminality and what effects they all have on the already overly sensitized and tandemically overly desensitized psyches of the communities they inhabit needs to become a dominant issue in culture. So while law enforcement officers may by definition not be our \"friends\" it might be time that they damn well think about becoming them or at least stray from acting as our enemies. And it might do us well to accept them as \"friends\" if they honestly extend the offer and not make ourselves enemies to them based on what we see in the trending multimediums as \"Brand Cop.\" Otherwise we together run the risk of giving birth to a new child, one that will feed not on milk but instead off the flesh and blood of its parents.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWasalu \"Lupe\" Jaco\n\n", "summary": "The letter addresses the complex relationship between law enforcement, criminality, and society. It highlights how the police are not inherently friends or enemies, but rather a reflection of the law they are tasked with enforcing. The letter delves into the blurred lines between obeying the law and feeling oppressed by it, as well as the impact of external factors such as poverty and systemic injustices on individuals' perceptions of authority.\n\nOne of the major themes in the letter is the idea of the law as a powerful force that can both protect and harm individuals, depending on their circumstances. It also explores the role of police officers as both enforcers of the law and potential abusers of authority, questioning the balance between upholding justice and perpetuating injustice.\n\nThe letter also touches on the societal implications of criminality and law enforcement, highlighting the ways in which these institutions can shape individuals' perceptions of right and wrong, and the devastating consequences that can result from misinterpretations or misuses of power.\n\nOverall, the letter challenges readers to consider the complexities of law enforcement and criminality, urging both civilians and police officers to strive for a more empathetic and understanding approach to justice and social order."}

The concept of being a \"thief\" could symbolize taking risks or breaking rules in order to achieve this goal, even if it means facing consequences.

The artists, B.o.B and Lupe Fiasco, talk about how people may try to figure them out, but they are not easily understood because they keep their true thoughts and feelings hidden. The shades symbolize a barrier or shield that prevents others from truly seeing and understanding them.\n\nThe lyrics also touch on themes of self-awareness, introspection, and the complexity of human emotions and thoughts. B.o.B talks about being ahead of his time and not being able to go back, perhaps suggesting a sense of loneliness or isolation in his perspective. Lupe Fiasco's verse delves into the idea of self-mastery, being true to oneself, and navigating through the challenges and distractions in life.\n\nOverall, the lyrics suggest a sense of complexity and depth to the artists' personalities, as well as a sense of mystery and enigma that others may not easily penetrate. The shades serve as a metaphor for the barriers we sometimes put up to protect ourselves, and the struggle to be truly seen and understood by others."}
