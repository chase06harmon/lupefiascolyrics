Mural,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes
 
wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not “rain” like “Rain Man” or rain like “rain dance”
Or rain like a “slight chance of rain” when it's rainin’
Or “rein” like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But “reign” like queens that reign over made man
And not “Queen” like “Queen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem’” Queen
But “queen” like white-glove-wave-hand
And not “wave hand,” like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking “wave,” like you saying, ""Hey, man!""
And not hay for horses
 or ""hoarsest"" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor,
 but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco exploring the complexities of identity and self-discovery.
Mural,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh!
 
Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets
 
OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff
, 
ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco exploring the intricacies of fame and personal identity.

Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey
","Write an introduction exploring the dichotomy between different portrayals of women in society, inspired by Lupe Fiasco's ""Bitch Bad""."
Bitch Bad,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average.""
And maybe other rhyming words like ""cabbage"" and ""savage""
And ""baby carriage"" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health,
 
he may skew respect for dishonor
",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco exploring the impact of a young child hearing explicit language in music.

Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood

Bitch Bad,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches.""
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

Bitch Bad,"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using ""bitch"" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
""Bad"" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But ""bad"" mean bad to him, ""bitch"" don't play a part
But ""bitch"" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!
","Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco exploring misconceptions and double entendres surrounding the word ""bitch."""

Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First off, say ""Peace"" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
, 
suicide bombers
And prosperity gospels,
 
emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels, and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism, and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash
A friend request, follow, and a hashtag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco addressing the impact of societal injustices and cultural influences on modern society.
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe

A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way
",Write a chorus in the style of Lupe Fiasco reflecting on the struggles of finding peace and freedom amidst chaos.
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco shedding light on the consequences of consumerism and societal ignorance.

Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central, an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city,
 
Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege, vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the mid-ler
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco reflecting on the disparities and struggles faced in different parts of the world.

Words I Never Said,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist

Words I Never Said,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells

So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

Words I Never Said,"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you

Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too!""

Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed

But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, an obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, 
and if I ever die

Or maybe she'd retire as well

None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dawg

And the bullets from his enemies sat, like, two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory; he didn't mind it, but—
He couldn't sip it fast enough

Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister

So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind

Pulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box;

If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life

odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel

They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin'? Is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat
 
and made it flat
And rather lifeless

well there's a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief

So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glatt
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
And other monkey business
Where killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

The dark is too hard to beat
And I’m not keeping up
The strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone

Take that back, make that 2 new shoes on the van floor
Me and my band out on that road
On a never-back-down-from-my-stance tour
Yeah, touch more souls than a dance floor
While they touch less floors than a hand or
Ceiling fan
 
or - wait, let me tell ya slower
Lift my fans up to the ceiling and you'll never touch the floor

I'll be there with my oar till we get back to the shore

illuminate my culture
While they watching through that buckle,
 
but I stay up on my hustle
Turn that belt back on they self,
 
now I watch them scream for help
Like Africa need aid, or black women as maids
Uncover undercovers turn those maids to Bubba's mothers
Take the hero out the Nino,
 
keep it real as trouble-trouble, huh?
Or maybe cartoon Martin on The Boondocks
Flip the script on chicks who think their shit smells like perfume shops
Help them girls find beauty without a magazine or movie
She Delilah with them .45s
 
or Keisha with that Uzi
Now I know that's contradiction, wants and needs in competition
But it's hard to stay on point with such extremes in opposition
While we waiting on that compromise,

All my hate is for the fake recipes for wrestling
Only time I wrestle's when I'm wrestling with settling
Only way I settle if we wrestle over everything

Mural Jr.,"[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Holy assumption of man into the heaven's sphere
Many mansions fit champions within its seven tiers
Evangelists re-imagine every 11 years
Pause for applause, evolves to what was never here
Born to death, born to die
Form the flesh, form the eyes
A veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies
Marital norms unperformed but the porn survives
In the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies
Gone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh
Before I was standing, I was landing
Two one-hand, one-man bands jamming in tandem
He who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms
And maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe
Got a talent trafficking ramblings
And handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth
Out the back of the wagon, out the back of the madam
Out the back of the Magnum, then out the trap of enchantment
Bellerophon with a megaphone, Mega Man
Desert zone, run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)
That was so simple but hot
In a place where it's so simple but not
Closed temples and old little forgots
And rode whole chisels, cripples who won't miss a salat
The old hoes that they won't give you a shot
But you can get the whole  pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot
These are real words from a savage mind
Unmaximized man on an average climb
Who don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time
Fit the life of a whole booth in only half a line
In the future life, I don't even have to rhyme
We'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs
Just yields and rail roads
In lush fields with bell tolls
Couple huddles of the unskilled but well told
It's unreal how off one deal to sell souls
And he got 'em by the dozen
Medulla oblongata is what got them by the oven
Like how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin
He got her by the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in
Such an unsettling scene
An obscene setting for the unwedding of rings
The sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens
The architecture is something you've never seen
Dream clean, that's three words at the same time
And killed three birds with the same--
And won each and every hand with the same bluff and
Answers each and every man with the same question
What is it? But you still wanna know but I already done did it
I ball heavy, the physics
It's all, but it's already specific
If we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific
That's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that
As an extra exhibit to what's already within it
The galleries lack the wall space
So I made a gallery of galleries, made of all space
If it was more small, it would be Moore's Law
From the land of the po' where we war, saw
From the hand of a pro to a whore jaw
Make her stand at the store 'til the snow thaw
Went from paper boy to editor
From throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer
On the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers
One of several sects who can come and charm the predators
We who measure the measuring tools of measurers
We who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers
We who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers
We who question the treasured rules of leveragers
Born to death, born to die
Mourn correct: immortalize
In a war, where your performance score is your salary
It's like fantasies combating your mortality
I'm just trying to restore sanity
Sigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your Vanity
To instill what kills krill destroys manatee
So heels spill but still seal deals that build factories
What looks Roman senator inner reveals Maccabees
Never just trust off guts, but what's actually
Unless it's Kuato's
Now, we back to pillars of salt, I recall back peeling potatoes
In hindsight, maybe attack of killer tomatoes
A seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty Pentium payloads
Now, that's another strata but I was making sense
Then cop out, took the highway and I was making chips
A nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks
Can fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6
This rehabilitation, I be taking trips
""Don't Ruin Us"" God said, I won't make a dent
Hardly, but I'm still Harvey, I hope this making sense
Devil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff
In the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs
To make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey Drive and a stomach for taking whips
I'm just trying to redeem
With these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean
To unify the hooks, if you know it, then come and sing
Don't bust in while I'm asleep, nightmares who come in dreams
Samurais rarely die from another sword

That was Bobby Johnson potato, just to underscore

But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie

To reinforce every single word that I talk with
Something about losing things, human beings
That reduces things to their most elementary
Find yourself where you never meant to be
With the energy of memories
That's the soul force of what's behind killing me
Finding pleasure in the pains
Like finding desert in the rain
Twisted: how this world can drive you masochistic

Or if I'm numb because I'm closureless
Or my closure's that we all gotta go and shit

Still happy that I opened it

But I feel that it's all lost, or maybe that it's all gotta cross
Happy with his dedicated song
But now he's all gone

But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot, you replied
""They need me in the hood,"" and that's where you reside
Free clinic, nobody denied
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside
And saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands

Did everything you could to keep this girl alive
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived

Hello Gorgeous
This phone call's probably being recorded
Just know that I did it for the four of us
And those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us
After this I'm going underground
If they come asking give them the run-around
How does Costa Rica in the summer sound?
Couple days then we moving to another town
Yea I know them dreams, seams
Just know that time'll never come between
Space either, fake features
Things that we reject but connects all us believers
The insurrection's gone viral
They'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals
Outta control, like a dam with a hole
From here on out it's all about survival
The way we left things they probably think we rivals
But don't be naive, they hate you more than I do
Remember always speak in opposites
I hate you so much, it's such a compliment

Of them fighting our water with fire
He said that we need something drier
To really impress the empire
Funny cause he really hated war
But why we went to war is what he really hated more
Said it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor
When he came back from the Corps
Is when he really got serious
Read a lot of books, started acting all mysterious
The VA is what really made him furious
Told him his condition didn't exist, period
That's why he started that petition
Went all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen
To a white male Christian
He just laughed when they took our father's pension
He said that you gotta act in opposites
Helps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant
But I knew he felt bad
Told me later was the saddest day he ever had
To see our dad so hopeless
That was the turning point that's what really gave him focus

Well, the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no

It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy""
Wasn't lyin', though—he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The ""kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk""s now took him to the crib
A lil' hurt from the rail he took into the ribs

He lived with being different, was combatted
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But just 'cause she was white, see, her life wasn't light-world
She, too, had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama-hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings

In time to make profit off the T-shirts
And monetize all the research
And leave Earth feet-first
Breech, behold
Whites get whiter in the cold
And colors don't fade in the bleach, hah
Applause then fall through a man-made south
Talking to a doll at the pancake house

I've done that, I've been there
This a comeback, let me unpack
And unwrap souvenirs

Flat like time on the run
Why you bring a holster to a gun rack?

Why you playin’ soccer with the Sonics?
That's a iPod to the Amish

Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, ""The blues""
""Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?""
""More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood""
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
""Where are all the pages?"" The paintеr said, defanged
""I ripped 'еm all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes”

""I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed""
""Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?""
The patron pointed at a pile, ""Are those rejections or mistakes?""
The painter said, ""That is not for question or debate
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
The product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint
A gift from the read for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face""
""Wow,"" said the patron with a smile
""That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground""

I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused""

Welcome to my whirlwind, turn like Tilt-A-Whirls

Going out, we goin in', say ""hello"" to my girlfriend

One Halls short to keep from coughing all in y'all face
Man, I'm so appalled, I can keep them all safe
I can really ball and put titties all in y'all face
That was Robert Paulson, and that deserves a pausin'
So that's Blart, Pierce, and all that's missing is a bearer
For the coffin that is needed for this beat when I'm done talkin'
Balling in the morning, this feel like my callin'
This the new bitches brew, fall off in my cauldron
Lupe's going crazy! Flow is going almonds
We going back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin
Then go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in
Destination everywhere, reputation everywhere
Music drop, music stop, one man take up every chair
I know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere
But it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure
Or maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over
Say goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow
Acting like I'm rapping, it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow

Killing is a dirty job: Michael Myers, Michael Rowe
Bring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go
I feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone

This your beat I'm sorry,
 
but her eyes were so starry
I just had to get some-uhh...one up it
Hit the bricks, drop the coins,
 pick up the shit
Like a pooper scooper 
even dog shit was once eukanuba
Underdogs of the past can be the shit up in the future
I brush my shoulders off to remove my bazooka
What we doing? Deck full of spades, hold a mic like Bob Barker
It's manure if you new to the ways of the lupester
The base meaning is I'm a roofer, (woo!),
 
I'm going like fuschia
All I need is a coup and a princess behind me like King Koopa
If a nigga with me and he black he might shoot ya
And that's motherfuckin real, even my mother, is fucking, real
Kitchen counter tapping then undercover skills
Your beat is in my bedroom giving head to 'em
Stretch it out, stand up in it and call it leg room
Beat the beat till it's beat there's eggs to 'em
Then repeat, eat it till it sleep, then wake it up
But then don't speak to it cause now it's like the feds to 'em
Beats having trouble going to sleep cause now I'm like Fred to 'em
And if I can be any meaner, our patina was Martin and Gina
To her I would have ran, but now she like Pam
She still want the flow but now I'm like damn
Whisk her away, but I had to scram back to the bullshit
Scramble to ya pulpits and tell the preacher he legit
Beats get weaker the deeper that I get
Damn right she ain't even get the shaft, I'm just speaking from the tip
When the fire gone then I quit, cellphone still along on the trip
So I can speak to the choir from the throne on my ship
And noble or sober or my song nobler
Eating with our hands and the waiter is a fan
Shout out to Mike Ferro keeping paper in my hands
Tailored Savile Row, or Mastermind Japan
Sky dropped six on the blazer
Drop top Aston versus Cobra, I'mma race ya
Free Rico, before he do his bid
Got a father tatted on him, gone show him where it is
Black dragon slayer they ain't knowing what he did
Want everybody in Bull city eating like a pig, lets do it!

Broken dancers rather flatten cardboards than work at Arco
Flippers who feat feets riff contortionists hips and grease slippers
Tweezers release slivers
From lines with deep splinters, paws for sweet skippers
Another key-figure's of East River's who eat liver and drink liquor
And root for Bird due to an unconscious urge to beat niggas
Who prefer sweet, steep sleep
And to pull hoes with the ease of police triggers

You see, it takes niggas weeks
They need a comfort zone and some beats
Lollygaggers to poly matters that go over responses
Get all layered and technical in they content
Press record, then I bring the receipts
Lambda Lambda Lambda, I think that shit was sweet
I wish I could just kiss you on the cheek
Nerds have they hands in everything
Gangsters won't even touch the police
Won't you tell your niggas get that
Take some of those cool fullies and go and get some of our shit back
Your problem is that you ain't never have no impact
Kit-Kats and chit-chat and syntax won't make up for how much you sit back
I think that nigga scared
He never leave Heaven 'cause he already dead
Damn, nigga are you insane?
What's the point in knowing how to point and aim
If the niggas you gon' bang look exactly the same?
That ain't motherfucking cool, that's a motherfucking shame
This ain't no motherfucking game
That's why I think you are a motherfucking lame
We both wear glasses, the difference is
I was in school thinking it was cool, you was thinking of skipping classes
Listening to your track record, I could see you were skipping classics
I did it on my first one and delivered to the masses
Your songs are immemorable, your verses are impenetrable
I ain't even listen to that diss record
I only fuck with you 'cause your interviews
I ain't even trip when you called me a bitch
I was like, ""Look at Salem, calling me a witch""
Look at how they made him, look how much they gave him
Look at all the assists, nigga, if it wasn't for Premier
You wouldn't be, if it wasn't for, if it wasn't for
If it wasn't for, if it wasn't for, nigga, I got a dozen more
Hov think I'm Hov, Nas think I'm Nas
That's the trick, you ain't gotta think when niggas already think you are
Muah!
Your story crooked and your book too, pass the dumb shit
But you would shoot somebody's son holding Sun Chips
I wish they would've left Biz here, and fucking took you
And all your hyper-technical hypotheticals
In life, I've never met with you, from a distance, I accepted you
From the podcast, I've been kind of skeptical
This ain't our first clash, this is just one of the several
I ain't trying to bash, but it was like you was off your schedule
You was throwing more than jabs, I was like, ""This nigga's incredible""
We had to fucking edit you
I don't know what vegan Detroit vegetable Dr. Sebi diet infected you
To think that we share the same metrics or somehow I was less than you
And I was the type of nigga that you could get really disrespectful to
I ain't never lectured you, I get energetic and joke
But in real talk, nigga, I ain't never disrespected you
I'ma punch you in your fucking face and we all think it's silly
I'm thinking like ""Won't this bitch nigga clean up his fucking city?""
I mean you got all of the clout, know how to bring all them niggas out
You can walk the walk, I mean, we seen you walk all over your house
But me and Mickey is geeks because you got some heat
Like I didn't go to the closet and put guns all over the couch
Your mental health hotline, I think that shit is grown up
But you're the very last nigga that should be picking that phone up
I spit your verse to get immersed inside my enemy
And to remind you they got to go through you just to get to me
Subtle subordination
Perpetual sidekick, nigga sort of a station that you used to
So you ain't got to get all extremely too personal on your albums
When you not surrounded by bigger artists to fucking boost you
Nigga, you called me, I didn't recruit you
But no regrets, I take it as a test
You said, ""Lupe, you gotta have some grace
Not be so haphazardly to put the truth all in they face""
Now that I think about it, that's kind of half-and-half
If a nigga asked you for the strap, why would you keep it in the stash?
If you ran the world, we'd get defeated in a flash
You really gonna be the boss, can't keep secrets from the staff
I learned that in the streets, nigga sweeping trash

Hijabs, hoodies, afros, locks
Teddy bear, liquor bottle shrines, rocks
Tanks, prayer rugs, church pews, Mexican corn stands
Blood, sweat, and tears, police batons
Gas masks and bullets create graffiti on corners
Murals that salute freedom or death for liberty
Be it Englewood or Egypt, Bedstuy or Baghdad
Syria or Liberia, the west bank or the west side of Chicago
Where food and liquor stores still occupy the block
While police and community watchmen justify why they shot
Emmit Till and Malice Green, Rekia Boyd and Trayvon Martin
Better not wear that hoodie while shopping for a carton
Or whatever they sellin’ in your food desert
Cause your soul is dessert and will be dissected and consumed
On the Fox evening news while we sing the blues
The New Jim Crow caged bird sings
Cause he’s tired of occupying his misery and of our marching
He wanna fly to a higher consciousness
But his school on academic probation
They gave him medicine, diagnosed him with a felony and mental retardation
So he refuses to cease the firin’, nobody’s hirin’
In Illinois, 67 is the new age when you retirin’
Class lines have blurred, those who used to have, have not
Pensions bein’ snatched
Those who never have keep their hands stretched
Social services being cut
Sterilization clinics giving out pills to numb the womb
Young girls referring to their vaginas as tombs
Thinkin’ protests are temporary and trendy
Well rock a t-shirt and carry a poster
And two weeks later it’s back to normal
But they say times are changin’
The revolution is becoming second nature
, causes are combining
People carrying torches, hope burning from their hands
Attaching explosive devices ‘cause they keep stealing their lands
In the name of freedom

Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on 
and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence

They get, high off that trunk bass and 20/20 rims
They rock braids, Air Force Ones, and Timbs
They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq, and 40's
They call they women hoes, bust downs, and shorties
They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full
Prisons packed, bubblin' over in brown sugar
They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered
The well is running dry
The days of Malcolm and Martin have ended

When it took twenty minutes just to download one
Aye, you got a fine face, also a dime in your behind
Please can I find some time space to find base
Kinds of rhymes to describe how you’re designed great
And maybe remove the mind freight

Exactly how you knew I'd do it
All my brothers, I would love to paint 'em Jewish

To leave where the native peoples were staying
Believe, my engagement ring received
And flossed at the cost of a bonded child miner's pain

Uh, Cecil Rhodes sowed war and genocide
Into the countryside just to get his shine on
I fear what De Beers and his peers used to do
Before the world really knew, just to get their mine on
Making paper with slave labor
And hitting little kids with life time bids making them cut and shine stones
Inflating the price and making them look nice
And I wasn't thinking twice when I was putting mine on
About a young shorty in Sierra Leone
Or other conflict countries that people call home
I figured I would never go to Angola
So it never did affect me there, maybe indirectly
That my neck leash was funding a rebellion or a military coup
Started by militias that don't believe in following none of Geneva's rules
I was brushing off the haters, trying to be cool
Didn't have a clue that the rapper was helping the rapers
Raiders of the villagers, pillagers of the schools
Shooters of the innocents, torturers of the witnesses
Burners of the businesses and my bracelet was the fuel

I'm just pushing the facts, fuck Bush
'Cause there's people doing worse on this earth and they're black
I took it there, yeah, now let me bring it back

But ask yourself, ""Do they finance yours?""
When I first got mine I took them out on tour
Didn't know they lost half the value when I took 'em out the store
Or it was full of moissanites and cubits
But the jeweler knew I was stupid
And that I couldn't prove it
Feeling like I need it because I do music
To impress the groupies and the interviewers
So I didn't appraise it, nor did I loupe it
Even gave them to my girl, thinking I was Cupid
Homies was all hate, hoping they could make me lose it
Creeping through my own hood, knew I had to remove it

The undercover terrorists and the traps for the hustlers

Why should he have such views of the ocean?
And not be hanging from the gallows with his neck neatly broken?

Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place, he used to stick his scissors in his sockets—damn
Clear that project runway, 'cause this is where my rocket lands
Ain’t got no problems, Houston
—I A.K.A. then rocket-land
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and I up in the sky, like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here, I’ve seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrassling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam—zoom!
Now, I’m like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk; 
I don’t flow, I ceiling
My mama said they need me
'Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth, like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full, so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G—now, you can see me
But your letter's still under my sea, like seaweed
C and G
 
but nothing 'bout me C-G

No we is up, 'cause it's like two of me

New York to East Coast is cuffed

Brave and fly; you backbone-less and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip—I’m coming for they fingers
'Til what they throwing up is meaningless

Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit

Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme

A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops

Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb

As he tried to do the math with Smearcon the fed
The contract states from here upon you're dead
The girl at the bar is an underworld star
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your name's on the list, kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
You’re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner
I got you a .45 and a Mitsubishi tuner
Wait, wait I've never been to Costa Rica
And then it all comes back
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head like..huh
Then they slowly enter the room
I grabbed a .45, the ninja stars resume
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast, blow
Three more shots for good measure
Only exit is another window, pfft, whatever
Short fall to the roof of the car
Then I get in, left arm covered in ninja stars
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining, heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining, blood draining
Pains, head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S. Class, in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work

So now I'm totes hecklers, everywhere

For a real good whiff
Of how life behind par seems
Until then she a bar-teend
And pour hot lead shots out of carbines
If an inmate ever even think about departing
Before it's time for the theft of a hard thing
Wanna see what a bum riding BART dreams
Before he get gunned down, cause some sharp scene
Saw it all on the way to the art scene

Life on ice like the San Jose Shark team
Hard times, tryna duck em like Darkwing

And other less harmful skylarking

A small Chinese-made American flag
Took a dollar bill then split it in half

A thick wool jacket on a cool night
Unimpressed by poems or the moonlight
Doesn't satisfy her like a game of pool might
Thinking 
""what if Fantasia had a broom strike?""
Tuned right out of that school life
Soon as reality became a camera crew and a boom mic
So what do you do like?

Like the Roots left Geffen

And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then, her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad
Back is like Afghanistan, Iraq

Am I scared of him or the ""nigga that blast me""
Or maybe just the hammer that goes to be a hole in an innocent bystander

My mind is Pro Tools my head is a stool
Whats recorded in my dome gets reported when I zone
My mouth is a speaker I'm anchoring the misery
There's no friends the enemy of my enemy is my enemy
Beakers and test tubes full of memories
In my labatory I create stories
Doze off then wake up surrounded by Forties
Wit Glocks tucked in they labels
And they caps is baseball hats
Playin poker at a table
Cigarettes massage they shoulders in belly tops showin off they navels

Hi-hats told police he was just a soldier he did what the Bass said

Pyramid,"[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Metabolize on the scattered snare
With the banana pies that he don't like
Like mosquito bites on the shins or ankles
In the end it bends
Let's begin and pretend it's tranquil
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire
, 
not the inch but the entire
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door
To let the divorced out with force
And other course routes, of course
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken
With rum in hand for the curse lifting
Onion bread with the shine to it
It's up and fair to define stupid
But she ain't dumb, at least she know that he ain't fun
And neither's Europe, even to the Middle Eastern tourists
Where oil is spent by the drum load
How many millionaires can the slums hold?
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
Of dust Parmesan immaculates
Head over heels like a back is flipped
The Japanese don’t perceive Atlanta-ness
Love labors, get her backstage like the judge chambers
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger
Or do us, oh foo us
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Runaways wait with the wayward kids
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush
We ain't hoofs don't boo us cause we ain't cooked
But who else could hook the fufu up
In this book I mean, dumplings with dark continents
Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt
Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po' kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit
She rollin'

Funeral processionals increase their frequency
Because we can't break the spell of Geppetto
No one knows
And scrolls of obituaries contain more words than dictionaries
That will define how lions in Zion became alley cats
Who traded their baseball bats for gats that spat
Blood of the people across steeples
And concrete jungles that turn playgrounds into graveyards
That buriеd generations of Black and Brown men who lеft their post
Because they were misguided by ghosts in the land of the living
Ready, aim, fire
Wanna be the block, but can't buy the block, bulldozin' the block
Makin' the Red Sea choke on bones of drones
Sent by PPP loans to see how you spent the money
Left, left, right, left
To figure it out while the ancestors watch and aid those who call out to them
Through altars, pay phones, saxophones, bottles of liquor, glasses of water
The sum of a son and a daughter equals new life, the holy trinity
He was a baby boy, but he was kin to me
Born to Basimah in hands of the lion who said
""Store your water in the basement, because one day, it will be scarce and polluted""
He said, ""One day, grocery stores will be baren
Learn how to grow your own food and don't get caught starin'
Down the barrel of a gun
Learn how to run underground drills in Zion""
To be reborn lest you be scorned by the ways of the wicked
Who pillage our communities and natural resources for profit
He said, ""My children, each of you are prophets""
Don't let money be the sum of your deeds
Pull the weeds from your mind
Look to the front, the side, and behind
You each have blades that will drill a new earth

Band together to reverse the weather to unite the seeds of the oppressed
Stand together and work righteously to be blessed
For generations to come
Drill down, Zion is in you","Write a verse in the style of Ayesha Jaco that delves into the struggles and resilience of marginalized communities, emphasizing the importance of self-sufficiency and unity."

N.E.R.D.,"[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Too many best-rappers, not enough best-rhymes, though
Guess I'm delusional, used to doing it all the time, so
Maybe I'm just jaded, out of touch and unrelated
Unable to connect greatness based on the person who makes it
Or maybe I just hate it
And that would make me hater
Maybe it is great but that don't mean it's greater
Having your profile raised doesn't make you a raiser
Being ambiguous with assertions, isn't making you safer
What you mean, though?
Line us up, paddling us on the back
Like we steamboat, you president of the frat
You goin' sling toast, like you Ringo
And you think Doc Holliday's
Just goin' tolerate and too sick to let that thing go
It's just a matter of returns
Ashes to ashes, scattered them from the urns
To start a fire shaky to gather them from the burned
And reassemble these ashes, the blackness is something firm
Then moving blackness backwards in the bread of some other shit
Any deep we spreadin' wheat seeds from a bucket shit
McDonald had a farm and he lovin' it
Rolls Royce of the scented voice against the arms of the government
Artists gettin' robbed for their publishing
By dirty Jewish execs that think his alms from the covenant
I'll retire when I'm tired, that's a Firestone death
Easy to say when nobody's there, like a microphone check
They wanna hear what I'm gon' say before the microphone check
Make me sign an NDA before the microphone test
'Less you face that type of faith, institutional opposition
Then with all due respect, you are not my competition
Nah",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco discussing the challenges of navigating the music industry and staying true to your craft.
Sittin’ Sideways (Remix),"[Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco:]
I tilt mine to the left, it's just the westside of him
Don't ride nothing but know plenty people, peoples that ride something

But first let me tell you where son grown
Grew up 'round GD, 
CVL's
, 
Black Souls and Unknowns
Hanging hat, banging sacks, slanging with guns on
Forced to drop the 
forks or you gotta run home
Or you gotta run anyway after you drop the folks
Cause they was really folks looking for somebody to jump on
Wars, lords shoot up all the corners they hung on
Hear the squeezing ring for my region brother to come home
Violations, laws, lessons, sessions and mandates
Picnic collections, lit sign throwing the handshakes
That's why I stay, drop eyes where I play

Closed up the store, sewed up the floor
Rose up the charts, sold up with the 4
Sold 5, sold 6, sold 30 more
Now I'm a kilo in the game like I was before
My life repeating like words in the corridor
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
Before I open the door you let me know if you are close kinfolk with the law
If not let's further explore
Same shit different toilet, yeah, I know you heard it before
I was the youngest of four, pop couldn't take it no more
Stayed together for the kids they couldn't fake it no more
Left me naked in the streets I had to take me a course
Not only made me a man, it made me a boss
The world chico, maybe it's yours
Maybe it's your time to die, get so hardcore

Blue and Black Jordan sportin' might get you applause for it
Peace treaty for like a week if Chief and them call for it
A hundred and fifty deep in the streets saying ya'll broke it
But what started that was a shorty walking down the ave in a Starter cap
Pop said he ain't want me having no part of that
Those happenings with the hats and things

Sittin’ Sideways (Remix),"[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh, See from youth, I wasn't a stranger
Pops schooled him to the El-Rukn's plus the P Stone Rangers
And as I grew up knew most of what had been threw up
Disciples loved the Geto Boys cause they was talking to Hoover
Time versus life is all a process
Drive-by's, gang fights and lockdowns had us scared of the projects
Couple Arab Knights and solid 4's I knew, thought that the Moes was cool
They said salaam alaikum too
Told my out of town friends to take off they hat
That they couldn't wear that, in the places that I was taking them to
My homies was breaking in, so I was breaking in too
If they started chasing them then they was chasing me too

Like hotel swimming pools, that's four feet
These niggas like the rooms, so suite
Priceline, so cheap
I'm the cell phone, they the room keys
I'm some shelltoes, they some shoestrings
I turn 'em off, I take 'em out
I'm Reverend Run, with the laces out
Adidas, so adios
All day, I dream, like I'm comatose
That's your ship sinking, and I'm so afloat
I'm T-Pain, I'm on a boat

Aw! a lifetime remembered, which is mine
Then recorded, put it in Georges then rewind then look into

And I don't wanna boast or brag
But for what most niggas hope, a nigga done had
Chop game with my folk and split it in half
You ain't gotta bring it back tomorrow, a nigga can have
Rich or broke, a nigga ain't mad
Self-esteem will make a Regal ride like a Silver Seraph
Just wipe the french fries off the seat
Lean back, and I tilt my hat, uh!
And nod my head to the baseline
Freebase to the 8 times at Baseline watching Jay put it together
I wonder if he knew
While he was mumbling that this would push Lupe forever

A lil good game, a lil hustlin' in it

some nice crushed linen

of course, the nice women
Can I get a mic check? And a lil light dimming?
And a fresh bottle of Voss, maybe with some light lemon?

Lu Myself,"[Lupe Fiasco: Lupe Fiasco]
Lu myself, first of all accuse myself for being a fool
All attempts to school myself have failed
To improve means to remove myself
From this pool of sharks, dark as the mood I felt
I’m losing fuel, that’s all the food I refuse myself
That’s how you do when you do yourself
And if I lose, I could never excuse myself
Till I grow old, sit back and accrue my wealth
You don’t stand a chance, matter of fact, you don’t have half the stance
To stand if you stood half a chance
Like c-h-a to dance with this man from the C.H.A’s
Give it up, just abandon plan
Since you don’t have half the stance like an amputee
You don’t have half the pants that it takes
To command a family
The fan or command a fee
So you will never get the ransom you demand from me
The good news, my foot’s loose, my hands is free
So I dance all footloose and fancy free
Big Ups to footloose and all the fans of me
My fan base expands from Vans to Timberlands
From mansions to Section 8 campuses B
I’m they champion and I ain’t even SoundScanned it, see, I been lamping
Whipping up an answer to these rappers who got it backwards
Like zipping up their pants to pee
Like I’m just a rapper and I ain’t dapper
I'm frequently fly, I can go to France for free
But I ain’t no fan in base, cooking up grams of C
We in a wet stretching O’s like rubber bands to feed
But that was white boy 100 grand to key
When I’m posted up with this little punk ass chump cash advance
That they handing me, I came back with birds like Brandon Lee
I came back with words in a stanzas G
Told ya, right back like Stan, I'mma stand till it answers me
I’m concentrating man, I'm an oscillating fan
When they wanna shake hands with me, it sucks right now
Hear it through ya spirit just dampens B
Like damn that was my man, what the hell happened to he?
His fan base is disbanded B
‘Cause his lyrics don’t mirror when he first landed see
Don’t give into this land to please
So help me God, I'mma kill it, that’s my word
Remove this blindfold, just give us a chance to see
And I'mma quit it the minute it abandons me
My plan’s to be here for a minute
Then I’m finished, then I’m vamping G
Most these cats is pussies, pearl tongues, oysters and clams to me
Flintstone money can’t even stand being in their glances geez
They say it’s looking good, from my vantage B?
Shit is sinking like Atlantis B and I’m more set than Alanis
What, you ain’t understanding me? Am I speaking Spanish B?
Well adios holmes, am I getting sloppy Joe? Well what am I, a Manwich B?
I got a Big Mac if you want a sandwich G
Who else you know keep the Mickey D tucked
With the windy on his shoulder?
 I told ya, give it up dog, it’s over",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco reflecting on the struggles and determination to succeed despite the obstacles faced.

Don’t Mess up the Children (Interlude),"[Interlude: Dr. Nolan Shaw]
Adults are responsible for teaching children how to observe the ways of their ancestors. In fact, 
God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up.
 In other words, 
God is saying, ""Don't mess up the children""
. African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying ""thank you"" or ""no thank you"" and other forms of common courtesy.

As I bug out and absorb this energy
Refer to my memories, the scenes of lines and rhymes
To put together for these times
Right of the top like suicide jumpers landed on your block
Ahhh... and do pauses like that and do ad-libs to stretch
To prefer that I'm the bestest more like a suggestion
But maybe it's the truth...
 
still falling of the roof
Thought I was dead but didn't hit the ground
Call the police and hit the pound
It's not 911 on your dial-tone son
It's a write around with a smile infront
See I do it like my flow when I was in '92 when I was in school
When I was rapping like Ghostface Killah with a higher baritone
With a ghost chain wallet and a megaphone zone
It can't nobody stop when the dreads grown long
So I'mma keep it Marley and never sip barely
The beer be the poison the food and the liquor
And you watch study the moves of the niggas
From the back with the jungles on the tack
With the mac tucked in with a strap bring it back
See I do it but I feel when it's done and then... you run
See I messed that up there but then the best up here
Tryin do that less up fear
And say, uh, moving like a movement do
You and you, me and him, is me and him 2 and 2
4 and 4 math don’t work and the bath don't work so I wash up in the shower for an hour
But the rain storm brain form many lines many times

But more no less homo
 
no zone goals deeper than mine when
I'm in time to climb to commit crimes
Every time I rhyme
The new york flow was kickin it
Chi town a second it so I'm like President Obama
When I'm ripping it maybe a terrorist maybe embarasses us
But never scareness us and everthing impareness
A pair of us is more, and better, and can’t no body stop, when I score
A sweater like a booster when I'm jumping
Got my polo on strong
And call me what I am like Nas, I'mma a don
So word to the homie in the hero never zero
And I move and I disappear
Represented like Shapiro in court
You still might lose
I get punshed but I still don't bruise
Fly like that cat semi-automatic
Tac the raps I give daps to everybody, back in the day
But there's more the o.k when I'm flowing it
Everybody tryna rock but I'm Chi-ca-goin in

Booom and 
I still do it like nuclear warheads fore-heads is full of these lyrics
And spirits is spirtual and can nobody stop the mathe of the attack
When the rap is so lyrical and then I bless up and yes up
And when I come through up you better put your vest up
Cuz chest shots ain't coming more like for the don
And I'm rapping like I'm going home like flowing on beats
And broken bones clits as I stick to your football track at attacking the rap pack
At exactment and can nobody stack to this
You can't stack up and back up
Rest in peace to my brother Esco as well as Stack Bundles
Far rock away king man we love you

When I be kicking and spitting and ripping it

So I shout to the best and 
I move you around like the nets to Brooklyn
Shooking and can't no body stop me can't take 'em where I took it

Homie just be sad
Cuz you missing out
I'm giving out more knowledge

And a university it's like two of me inside of this

Jaded so denigrated and inundated

A pyramid to a mummy, they even pay attention even when they ignore
My compulsive indecision made addition into a chore

Give 'em shirts they can strain spaghetti with
Extra button holes for touching those

By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll

Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East
, 
I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way
, 
may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, 
you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market

Nobody is coming to get this junky. All his body parts are expired probably why he was getting doped up.
Two years ago he'd of been stripped clean before he hit the ground. But now designers parts are so easy to come by he's good as gum wrappers
Don't know why they shot him though. Cops these days. You never know. Disposal might come in a couple weeks. Might not.
Valentines Day. Hookers working overtime. Flower shop empty. Whole city in love with something or atleast pretending to be.
I step into the diner and work my way through the crowd waiting on tables to steal a seat at the counter. It's always a seat there.
5 coffees, 3 grits, 6 eggs, 2 toasts, 9 sausage.
 She hands over the 
glasses
. I inform her these are dirty. She doesn't care.
I wipe them on my jacket and put them on. 5 blinks equal 25 Units. She slides me the black tray with the pills and sneers out ""Bon Apetite""
Units are stored in the eyes. Blinking releases Units into receiving glasses or goggles or contacts and your purchase is complete.
They updated the toast. Coffee is still terrible. I spot Tall Creole at the end of the counter popping back Gin pills raw. A reality freak.
I look back down with my eyes half over the top of the glasses
 & see the 
black tray in the glasses I see a plate overflowing with breakfast.
I like to stay one foot in & one foot out I guess. I can take being lied to. Being a liar comes easy too. Here its an expectation of sorts.The human body still isn't used to digesting pill food properly. Updating is a constant to combat the side effects. Shakes, vomiting etc.
Better than real food though. That shit will kill you. So many additives and molecular advertising in it it's damn near plastic.
Tall Creole shakes violently, damn near falls off stool. She's almost ready 4 the night to take her. I hope she makes it out the other side.
I grab the Shake Handles connected to the stool and prepare for my turn. It comes. I wink a tip. Take off the glasses & head into the nite.
---1 Million Units Respond For Details--- glows in the left hand corner of my mind. I've been thinking about it this whole time.

Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective (Chapter Five: Gumbo),"[December 5, 2013:]
Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective
Chapter 5: 
Gumbo
Morning. 
The sky is a television screen.
 
The ""sky"" is the bottom of Central Park
A sunrise and a sunset and all other galactic phenomenon are broadcasted across the bottom of Central Park to be viewed by us Downstairs
The bottom of Neo-Harlem provides the same courteous service to Neo-Orleans which won its spot underneath us. We call it the basement
Underneath that in no particular order is Old London, Sau Paulo, what's left of Los Angeles & Moscow and that's pretty much it
City states stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob.
 Earth decided to a go a little nuts orbitally speaking.
Scientist still can't explain it. But in short Earth began spinning out of control &. what wasn't literally thrown into space was BBQ'd off.
Some say that's it all a conspiracy and were actually living inside some science project out in the middle of the desert & 
nothing is real.
Either way here we are. The cities or at least the parts that were able survive the tumult & the apocalyptic meltdown that followed...
..signed treaties and created 
""The Caste"" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.
The rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.
Everything else, 
religion,
 philosophy, crime, etc just kind gets in where it fits in. Not lawless but definitely ""law-least."" Why not?When the very Earth you live on takes an unexpected shit on you & your way of life everything kinda goes out of focus. Welcome to the blur.
The position of the real Sun over Central Park hasn't changed in about 100 years.
 If it wasn't 4 the Nano-Gravy it would've been burned away.
It's literally the tip of the iceberg. Gotta be ""born"" there to live there kinda jazz. An Invitation only Taichi party for the fancy tyrant.
It's ultra-simplistic in form. Just grass, the glass buildings and the all encompassing Gravy. 
No history, no future. Just never-ending now.
No pressures, no sympathies. Just calm and nihilism. Hence why 11's request, I mean threat, to bring his daughter back is so out of order.
Down here in Neo-Harlem it's none of that. It's all about maximum consumption all the time. Crime & nostalgia & love & hate.
Living like no tomorrow was yesterday. Like the end of the world came and left us behind like bastards on the steps of an abandoned church.
Luckily ppl still want2 find things so that keeps me employed. Luckily 4 them Im really good @ it but maybe not so lucky 4 me this time tho.
I spent the night pondering my next few moves. I knew I needed a Mambo Queen and that meant going Downstairs to Neo- Orleans.
For obvious reasons I'll need a disguise. And a guide who knows her way around...
an Eve to lead Adam to the Apple tree.
 
An Eve indeed!

""Happy Valentines Day Baby"" she says with a wink. I fell for the Mohawk. She fell for the 10,000 Units. The business of love in the streets
Had to relieve some tension before I made my first move. Decisions made while being tense always come back to bite you in the ass. Clarity
""Everybody"" just for 1 person. Seems a bit extreme.
 Even for a ""Parker."" 
You'd think all that Taichi would make them a little more peaceful
A little more humane. Hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point.
 This whole thing has funk on it
I know 11 was serious though. Deadly serious. 
Serious as the 100 Million Units he winked at me when I refused to take the job
Serious when he said in 5 days he'd ""update"" every food pill in Neo-Harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;)
Get rich and save Neo-Harlem. I like that.  Getting lost in the VooDoo and probably end up destroying Neo-Harlem anyway. I don't like that
Things tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. I got both. Mix fear with reward. I'm impressed
Lost dogs are easy. Easy as pie. Find some shabby two-Unit witch doctor have him call some flea bag back from the VooDoo, Exorcise & Upload
Getting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. Not pie at all. Devils pie is what it isShit!

She stopped laughing when I showed her the high side of a million Units for her troubles if she so volunteered for the task at hand.
Her body was perfect. Her timing was perfect. Everything had a symmetry. It all fit together with no excess. Seamless. I knew better.
This was all somebody's chess. Lotta thought went into it. Big thinking too. Either I'm underestimating someone or they are me.
Either way I'm on the board now and I feel that the games just getting started. She's gonna know somebody that knows somebody. She did.

I like the old school I tell her. Old fashioned. Old music. Old guns. One foot in and one foot out. She remembers something and smiles.
""I like both feet in the pool baybee."" She says while pulling two real cigarettes from her small purse. She walks one over to me.

It's distant, you'll find yourself trippin on a different set
We don't mix and mesh, mix and match
You gotta flip the script this isn't act
Nor pat, veteran not veterinarian
No holy water? then presbyterian dairy then
Strippin stacks, pussy on the pole like missing cats
Where mister whiskers at?
What's that? Poles of guns
Stacks of sеrial numbers, they getting scratchеd
Like give to backs and get it back
Came with different strats we spittin facts all in the cracks
Still real even when fiction's spat
Hit the mat your Jujutsu wack
I'm Malcolm X with the temple tap
Money talks credentials chat
Simple raps, if I give you Shaq' the rim will crack
Then we can't even ball no more
Vlad won't even let a nigga call no more, damn
It's like everybody wants me switched and replaced
Lose the joy male strip I'll still put a dick in your face
Like slam dunks
Out of work, chaturbatin, ex-rappin, man hunk
With all my bods in handfuffs
Old woman paid to pull his pants up very slowly as he stand up
Haha, comedy shit
And i'll calm yo ass down like lobotomy sticks
Steal a nigga will like a robbery whip
Battle rappers be like ah ah
Switch the style up, emphasize the end rhymes and
Get your growls up, nigga like me will wash a nigga
Then pick the towels up, look back down, pick the tiles up
Reach through the floor grab the pipes and lift the house (yup)
Now, that's clearly hyperbole
In real life i can take a real knife, certainly
And throw it real nice and take a Glock 19
And keep my bullet circles real tight
I'm talking holes through the same hole
Fruit ninja, oranges and mangoes
I will slice them shits
Put the video on IG and watch you like them shits
Real talk, simple preachers
The most to lose leave us
The black ghost of Tsushima
I make genghis falls like losin jengas
Livin limosine scene that'll make a tina move from abusive singers
Real talk man the truth'll sting us
Dope fiends loot the leaners salute the slingers
Prostitution, the cops won't move a finger
Except to shoot and make us choose between us
Test your loyalty, arrested royalty
Won't king us but will make us rich
The mental acrobatics will make you flip
The fact you ain't figured that out should make you sick
Ah, but that's how the game goes
I just want flying cars so I can
Put a benz in the sky like rainbows
And get a gold ak-47 with diamonds in my aim holes

Sway in the Morning (2015 Freestyle),"[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Represent intelligence I did it before
When I came through, sold out all the albums in the store
Shout to Joey Bada$$, that’s that, uh
Now we bout to backtrack
When I first started I was seventeen
Came up in the game, had a ring, had a chain, had some things
Shout to Chilly Chill man he showed me the game
Drove me around the city in the black, black Range
But now I’m back, at it attack
Had to do it again, and now we signed to Epic
But I ain’t never stretched I got robbed on my first deal
And that’s so real you wouldn’t even know it
That was about nineteen and I didn’t even show it
But I was the best rapper in the crew and they knew
Shout to [?] and shout to Butcher B
And shout to D-Low and [?]
Yea, yea, yea, and bring it back
We was raw dope records
Every single sector we was in, we would bless it
Howard home coming, I did that before
And they ain’t even know
Now, was we in this, or what were you doin’
I signed to Arista next and I was brewin’
Shout to 
L.A. Reid
, did my thing on the page
But never planted the seed to turn into a stage
Yea, I was growin’ stage up
And when I got up on that joint, I was blowing stage up
Now, I’m back in the rage I said the stage twice
That’s cause I set the stage, so nice
You ain’t even catch it so I gotta bring it backwards again
On the stage I was attacking my friends
But I was attacking my foes, save no bitches and save no hoes
Sway, you know how it goes in these streets
How it goes in these beats, how I do it so sweet
How I do it so neat and I wrap it in a package
And I bow-tie that every time that I wrap it
I lost a little breath, this is real time rap
In real time, every time, I real rhyme that
Yes, yes, I will rhyme that
And they can’t do it like I do, they try to but
You know it’s blessings when you come through like this
Impressed like this and how I’m dressed like this
All black cause I’m mourning for my brother
I love Esco, they don’t even know, how much above you
I don’t place anything
I wed the game like a wedding ring
With a diamond set-it-ting
And you know I’m never settling
I rap burn things down like acetylene
I said this before, only wrestling with settling
I only settle if I wrestle with everything
And I mean it from the heart
From the time when I was in the park on the benches I was rapping
Snapping, trapping and doing my thing
Yea I did the street a lil bit, did the heat a lil bit
Did the beats a lot, and now I can’t stop
I dropped my fifth one, I feel so proud
I hope you blow it up while you smokin’ your loud
Or you sittin’ in your room in the basement and you cherish it
Uh, every rapper I embarrass with the flows and the structure
The beats, rhymes and rhythms
How I give ‘em, how I put it together in exorcisms
How it skz’s like a schism
Bring scissors how I cut through the rhythm and bring it back again
And again, and again
Shout to all my friends, shout to all my brothers, all my lovers
I love y’all
And shout to Young Thugga, you a good lil dude
I like the way you rap too
See, there’s blessings in this
It’s a message in this, it ain’t no testin’ in this
Now, let’s get back to the narrative I signed to Atlantic
And everything was good
Until 
Craig Kallman
 called WGCI and said “stop playin’ Kick, Push”
We was like “what the fuck?!”
Fuck are you doin? Tried to bring my crew down
Tried to ruin us
But you didn’t know what you was puttin’ into in us
Then Chill got locked up and everything stopped
I wanted to stop rapping, but I couldn’t
On the phone when I’m cryin’ like “I couldn’t”
But he was like “nah, you gotta carry on”
At least for me, your family, you gotta bury songs
That mean you gotta dead ‘em
Every time you got in the studio he put the Glock to ‘em and head ‘em “bang!”
Yea, doin’ my thing, shout to the gang
Shout to the man, it’s how I maintain living in the mainframe
Should I ever do this before, again, I dunno it’s the same
It’s a shame but sometimes you gotta get on that paper plane
And fly to the other side of the earth
And show you truly what’s your worth and your values
If they don’t know you gotta show ‘em how to
If they don’t understand then you gotta make ‘em over it
You gotta do it again, and again, and again, it’s over with",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco reflecting on overcoming challenges in the music industry and staying true to your craft.

Paid for the foreplay, you might as well stay for the orgy

There goes the goals, more rose into fannings

Turn a jalop sob to a drop-top
Good as galop jamming to a Pakistani
I cop the first stone, thrown by the bone
Picky gavel handling
I love to judge misunderstandings
Throw it back at 'em like a javelin
They got me banned from the bar
When you can't stand like a man in the car

Harsh, not for cuddlers, but for butcher knife jugglers
Jumpin' out of jets over jungles in search of jaguar jugulars
A paper bag is child's play, someone is mistaken
I practice rapping myself out of bear traps, a straight jackets like a vacation
But let's say it's a paper bag, and I'm hog tied and gagged
Handcuffed to safe then locked inside the trunk of a cab
Then the cab is driven to the river, set on fire
You know what skip the river lets say quick sand cause quicksand's thicker
Makes it harder to move, especially when the dynamite is being triggered
Oh that I forgot mention, we added a little TNT for a lil' extra tension
Then comes the explosion
A shower of pieces of cab, safe, sand, handcuffs and paperbag
The crowd stands silent, maybe a few gasp
Just when all hope is lost, and the crowd gets really sad
The smoke clears I appear with cucumber slices on my eyes enjoying my mudbath
Saying, ""This all you niggas got for me?! Next time tie me up properly
Lu-Dini is unimpressed by this shoddily botched locksmith mockery!""
If I'm trapped in a paper bag just make sure it's a pen in it
Cause that bitch gone look like the roof of da Sistine Chapel when I'm finished
Paper Bags?! I'm the guy they use to rap the mouth holes in paper masks
A major task's for any one not trained in the art of hatin' trash
That's why I practice so fiendish

That leaves behind lines thick as linguini

Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it downYeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market

But wishin' it never lands

Presently en route to the rise of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French,
 and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Pleasing to the critics, but pointless is the common passerby

In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war
And so on and so forth",Reflect on societal critiques and personal principles in the style of Lupe Fiasco.

My aura takes the form of the aurora borealis
Or a floral pattern, more or less a forest to your salad
The neural path I’ve traveled has immediate reaction
Can’t you see that I am beaming? I’ll be leaving in a second
Sipping magic from a chalice, detached from the distractions
At last, I can relax, looking past all of the action
A fraction or a fragment of me actually is present
The rest of me is heavenly, the seventh house’s zenith
Yes, the fence intimidates, it’s meant to keep you out
But let your senses resonate and leap it in a bound
Cause freedom isn’t found inside a visa or a crown
And even the voice of reason couldn’t speak it out loud
But mortals are immortal when their soul has been imported
To a source that is more sovereign, important to the whole

Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'""

Promised him the lives he seen on TV
He ran packs across town like rhyme CDs
And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks
Stackin' too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
Saving, he promised his Mom a crib in Atlanta
And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer
So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases
No more cross-town, now he's crossin' them states and
Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust
So when the door kicked open they screamed, ""This is a bust""
""Is it a set up?"" it seemed funny, a scuffle broke out

Get the flame, aim, pop open the box and take off
Out the back of the pawn shop
Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car
He felt like he been hustling so hard
Like a demon he pumped a cold heart
Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart
Put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
He did the drop, one ring in a bag
Envelope, all the money he had
Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail
In the box was a bullet made of gold
Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band
And he stared at it, sitting in the palm of his hand
And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
It was his wife in the picture on his side
With the ring on the finger on the week that she died
As he looked in the reflection at those eyes so red
He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head
Like that","Write a verse in the style of Mike Shinoda, detailing a story about a man who finds a mysterious box with a dark outcome."

But he couldn't risk it
Put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
And told her goodbye
She started to cry
But he knew if he could distract 'em, he could buy her some time
And she could make it out alive
Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
Space mine had blew one of the hands off
Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth
The final saga in the Seven Planet Wars
Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like...","Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco, depicting a heroic sacrifice made in a space battle to save a loved one."

And then I'm wittingly fitting, and getting pussies to quit

I'm committing to hitting, and now I'm pitting my whit

From the womb of miss Latonya, like to thank Almighty God
Life's been nothing but a beauty to me, minus all the scars
Let my CD be my eulogy if death should overcome
Envy me cause all this jewelry that's hanging off my arm
Address any beef cause truthfully I fear no man but God
It ain't nothing you can do to me...my life is in his palms
Sent my enemies to shoot at me, I pray for every one
Learned about the birds and the bees watching dirty porn
Pops you let me go through puberty without you...You was wrong
Love my step pops but truthfully we never had a bond
Can't be mad at that cause biologically I'm not his son
Even when I'm at my best, I'm still equal to a crumb
I'm so insecure, had my self-esteem snatched young
If you a beast then prove to me you grew to be what I've become
I do this in my sleep, goofy, no one eats until I'm done
Teachers called me dumb, grant my school was so damn boring
I don't know how I passed, sat in class all day drawing
But with the help of Almighty God I made it through Bowen
Gave me a fake diploma, and ever since that day I've been sewing
Can't waste a moment, every day I wake I pray for atonement
To save a place in Heaven's gates, it's safe to know where you going
Nobody knows the day when Gable's trumpet gone start blowing
And you separated by your faith, and it's all over in moments
I do this for the homeless, all the hustlers hugging the corner
With crack and marijuana focused on a stack cause they hunger
That little boy that all the rappers influenced, clapping and stomping
No Papi to school him, happy selling crack to his momma
I do this for that little girl that's having sex for new jumpers
Unprotected, pregnant, infected cause she let niggas run her
Somehow, I always knew I'd be the one to survive
Stop putting diesel in them needles as a way to get high
Should be illegal how it's set up for our race to divide
Girl, you young and beautiful...make them wait for the pie
Don't do the usual, and bet he gone inspect you in time
Lord, give me strength to speak to the blind
Said if I seek I shall find
Black people this is theme for the mind
And I ain't preaching, I'm just reaching my kind
Reality for the grind
Before I leave I'm trying to save me some lives
George Bush will never take me alive
Nigga life's been gutter, mainly cause of our skin color
So when it rain, let the brain beith your umbrella
I give a shout to all the single parent mothers
Families of all the innocent victims that die for nothing

Little apricot on the crêpe I eat
Running late on my Casio face I see
Chefs in the kitchen tryna bake my steeze
But I keep it chilled, bout a 8 degrees

She said she loves me, And I believe her
Making it 100 times harder for me to lead her (on)
I'm so eager to prevail
If music was a female I'd shag her
And end up coming quicker than an e-mail
Bye, ?, Au revoir, Arriba!
I'm going overseas so hide your daughters behind the doors
The minor tours and tore them down like minotaurs
Fine
With metaphors from when I thought clitorises were dinosaurs
(Sway) But I don't roll with a tech
But I will, if you go against my code of respect
If I don't hustle then my heart will stop
Back in Britain, rappers press up half the stock
I move and they ain't moving half the stock
And they can't fit in my shoes, so put a sock in it
Better yet a stocking 'fore I sock it to you
You're a laughing stock
America passed my ?, pass the buck
I'm about to blow so fast before I started
We've already passed the aftershock
(She loves it)
And I still believe her, making it 200 times harder for me to handle it
I'm coming to America
But I ain't playing football with you folks
Cos the last time, the bloke picked the ball up
And ran with it
Pass me my passport and my cargo

I can't go

Outside isn't what it seem
It seem like nothing up the sleeve
Until it's something loveless digging holes to cover up with leaves
Between you and your pumpkin seeds, and powerball, and Sunkist Peach at 1 or 1:15 AM
When all you want is drugs and peace
All you get is waves and waves of uninvited company
Ranger, cleric, hunter, thief
Druid, Vandal, huckster, Priest
Amateur usurpers and catechism deserters, re-tuning truffle pig noses to catalytic converters
In between the stirring creatures, I'm keen to the furthest needle drop
Before requesting stitches, it is not that type of needle dog
Dog, the truest unicorn of all is human at rest
Waltzing through some hood the future forgets
I just been cooped up in that cuckoo's nest, one phase after complaining, which depending on your frame is apathy or acclimating
Happy cutting off and jumping in and yelling someone shut the top
It isn't just some funyun run that got him on that ""cut the lock"", it's

Corridor after corridor, a never ending meta-narrative that forever cabbages
Inside of your word salad sandwiches a formal moral beef
I don't I call 'em teeth I call 'em oral coral reefs
Let 'em sink, ya still in sync the more you pry you'll find another five
Hiding inside like a denieds ride across a border, multiplys, ya strict discarder is outrunning ya inner hoarder
The more you excavate it, the more it just absorb her
Can't Art and force a Mario Cart into a Forza
Obscure ya speed limit and then record ya Porsche
Report to court more than Zsa Zsa Gabor divorce lawyer
According to my FOIA spit fire sword drank
In a speakeasy wrote peace treaties in war paint!

Inside of the sock is just another tube
You can put it on if your foot is long
If you find the lost legs of my journeys, tell 'em I'm looking for 'em

Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine

Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail

Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot

Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us

Fought in your wars and our wars

In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Funny, 
I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing
In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one[Chorus: will.i.am &

Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I would've fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control

315 dollars ain't worth it",Write a verse in the style of Common exploring the tough decision of whether to bring a child into the world when not ready to fully take on the responsibilities of parenting.

Retrospect for Life,"[Verse 2: Common]
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the 
beadies
 and let's have this boy","Write a verse in the style of Common reflecting on the complexities of love, parenthood, and personal growth."

Letter to the Free,"[Verse 1: Common]

Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings

Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? 
Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made  his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This broad from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time

So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me

Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day

Between peace and prosperity, so marry me

I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, them feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real player you can’t take this game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away
Devil in a red dress, but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-to-day-to-day-to-day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation

A Song for Assata,"[Verse 1: Common]
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life; she thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room; she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all",Write a verse in the style of Common that tells a powerful story of police brutality and resilience in the face of injustice.

A Song for Assata,"[Verse 2: Common]
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people","Write a verse in the style of Common, exploring the struggles and resilience of a woman wrongly imprisoned and separated from her child."

Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream

What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

Began, began with time
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the 
catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right

G.O.D. (Gaining One’s Definition),"[Verse 2: Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and 
the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown

One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this

Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings

Who wanna battle?! I'm bad to the bone marrow
The earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows

Far more advanced
Than a rapper whose career you could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance

Escape rooms with glasses of wine
Just another crutch for my brokenness
A term that I got from my therapist
As a black man, I feel I should be sharin' this
In the hood they say we crazy and we derelicts
But we needed for our kids and our marriages
The old folks say we don't do that
But taking care of self is the new black

Mediation, mindfulness, it's just given to praise
I'm in a phase, all I see is victory
You on that wave, then come and get with me
I only want what's meant for me
And say the things that's sent to me
In penitentiaries, I met the most enlightened
Finding the losses, Heaven's excitement

On a quest for love like the ""Proceed"" drummer

Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times, my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and Jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seeming contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip-hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could've sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key twenty
Young blood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man

And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion

Invisible man, pictured below
With the hieroglyphicable prolifical flow
On the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door

Us Back, coldest raps, for me, the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray, there's gotta be a better way
People dying every day, wonder what would heaven say
Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels prayed

So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did Like Water for Choc, that album changed a lot

Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down

No longer over your shoulder do we have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, 
chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry and there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows

Sojourner's truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm

No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called bitches because they a boss

Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending
, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no fear no mysteries

For those of us who come from less than enviable circumstances
Dreams, good dreams, sweet dreams,
 dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God

Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin

Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable

We're getting ready now, he 'bout to walk the aisle
A pimp's funeral, but we're gon' walk in style
I'm feeling proud, yet I'm feeling funny
And it ain't cause his niggas still owe me money
Cause it's my buddy here
We've been through lots of years
Lot of beers, lots of fights, lots of nights
Dreams about our career
Now we're here in these tuxes
I remember back when we was hustlers
Move work, doing dirt, girls say we ho'ed around
Still doing it, we're just older now
Fixing his bow-tie, his collar, I fold it down
I'm the best man, I'm supposed to hold it down
We're sober now, but I'mma be lit tonight

He said ""The Light"" is his first song, I'm honored
It's already been drama, she don't like his momma
Maybe that's karma, huh, he's a good cat
A good cat ain't supposed to be with a hoodrat
I knew her back, back, when we went to FAMU
And like a black college, a lot of niggas ran through
Scandalous, the type you can't trust
Whatever you get her is just never enough
Plus, about her, I know too much stuff
Of being straight bogus, she's on the cusp
I'mma hush, cause today is his big day
These colors we're wearing, yeah they're a bit gay
But anyway, I told him when we first started
Now we must toast for the sincerely departed
Am I being jealous-hearted, I'm debating

His relatives saying they just can't relate
To her being his Mrs., it's a big mistake
I feel the same way, I'm tryna be supportive
It's hard when I think of ball players she then courted
But I ain't gonna agitate, I congratulate
It's like a weave, half is real, half is fake
They knew the caterer, so they got it half the rate
Her father, Mr. Cook, looking like he half baked
Pimped out in red velvet, his suit match the cape
Looking at his watch, damn, how much these pastors make?
But wait, oh shit, there go his ex-girl Shawna
Man, I hope it don't be no drama
That lady in the big hat, that's his grandmama
For him taking a step, I at least gotta honor
Cause maybe she changed, and I'm just tripping
We're walking down the aisle, the CD is skipping
I read between the lines, see, that's the sign
Kind of mixed about when it will be my time
To settle down
Her little niece Sherice throwing petals down
Looking at marriage
Narrow is the aisle, as they were saying their vows
A ghetto phone went off with the song all loud
Wiping my brow, cause now I'm nervous
She looking beautiful in her dress, I'm looking at her curves
It's natural to look, I try to look off
He said, speak or hold your peace, I gave a good cough

Chicago, discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman that I had to mention
Extensions of a young man raised on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Know Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young niggas want a testy hood
Yes he stood, taller than most black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
College in Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all niggas love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9"", big heart, big mind
He spent a lifetime wantin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me ""The Message""
It was his messages in life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
The Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, ""Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em""
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
And said, ""Son, we live through our generations""
Offspring, coughing, 
Gene Ammons playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him","Write a verse in the style of Common reflecting on the impact of family, spirituality, and generational legacy."

Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the opps come
Pop some, ops run
This ain't a game nigga, ain't no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the Gods is

Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Glaciers of ice, lasers, and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Made for the life, fall out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggas got a lot of rounds
Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound

Face on T-shirts with no hashtags
Just big ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here shit

Fake ass gangster, quick to take a fag's cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's
Two trey 8's, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Then here come the fame
But they won't say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens, and kings
They drilling on my land but ain't no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can't even moonwalk
My little cousin Bump J don't know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface casting at the crib I don't know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That's why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered that black power didn't keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rapping to you
Looking for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on

Even been to prisons to visit you
Ask, ""What would Christians do?""
Well some are harassing Native Americans
If God is love, why is hate in the air again?
Search for Samaritans in the hood, misunderstood
A savior comes, will he only come for the good?
The lost tribe of Shabazz
 and the second class
God, I see you in the streets where the checks is cashed
Hear you in the heartbeat, hopin' that love'll last
I know you in the words, ""Where the first is last""

We were Buffalo Soldiers, dreadlocked Rastas
Praying to Jehovah, Rafa, in the back of cop cars

It's in the passion of the teachers and the rockstars
The muslim sisters singing ""allāhu akbar""
It's coming from where Maya and Pop are
It's in the grandchild's stare up at Papa
""Love is love"" became the mantra
The montage for creation, we need it in relation
When two ships pass, one love is the flotation
It's what God used to put the planet in rotation
It's what the culture used to build a hip hop nation
From the basement to the attic, where cookie show for magic
It's what we told the world when we said our lives matter
Turn the student to a master, hustler to a pastor

Man, they gon', they gon'
Man they gon' knock this
And ride out to this

7 Deadly Sins,"[Verse: Common]
It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy,
 on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking with you 
but
 commit infidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it
Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon' want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven",Write a verse in the style of Common exploring the seven deadly sins and their impact on society.

Show me that you love,"[Verse 1: Common]
Embedded in emotion, I'm open, hopin' whoever's
Calling's all in for the low-key, it was O-M-O-Y-E
I read my daughter's name slowly, I'm asleep, sleepin'
With the TV on, two in the morn', ""Who the hell is this?""
On some Biggie Warn', something's wrong, what's going on?
You should be under covers, warm, is there a thunderstorm?
Someone done you wrong? Words stumbled on, she mumbled on
Something's on, oh shit, she lit, a habit she got, legit
We talked a bit, truthfully I was tired
Youthfully, she was high with her friends, I said bye quick
The phone collided with my sleep again, three minutes later
But there's another layer, she said I didn't care
She said I wasn't there when she was younger
Summer tour buses wasn't enough to show what love is
She said I did things that a dad doesn't, and that she had questions
If I'm a good father, why all the bad judgement?
I'm looking past judgement, about to ask somethin'
But she was bag bustin', inside I'm mad, cussin'
Inside I'm sad, dustin'
 off my pride
I thought that I did protect and provide, and I'm a father that's live
What about them rides with you in the backseat?
You tellin' me if it's a wack beat, I came to a few track meets
Weekend movies, I got you tickets to Lil' Uzi
Truly I try, she said
""It's the things that you didn't do, not what you did""
It hurt her spirit when she saw me with another woman's kid
Peeled back and thought, to love her, I gotta listen
Now love and action is the new vision, she said
""Dad, let your actions be your loudest speaker""
And now my daughter is now my teacher, with love",Write a verse in the style of Common reflecting on the complexities of fatherhood and learning important lessons from his daughter.

Or should I be prepared?

Show me that you love me

We got black cards, now they gotta deal with us
Rihanna got a bil', they gotta deal with the sisters
In pursuit of happiness, I ask God to Will Smith us

And I didn't have to break in this time

And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to rassle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the Underground Railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree without The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em'
, we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You might hear Big Will, and Mrs. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I follow the musical sounds of A Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I call on a Black Girl Named Becky
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children","Write a spoken word piece in the style of Common's father, Pops, giving praise and honor to all children and spreading positive messages of love and peace."

We layed under the cover of friends

I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard tryna understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grill
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me, ""Hold me"", a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight, she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did

Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair

Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs

But the creator was sending for her

'Cause a cop'll stop ya
And have you at 
a hundred and eleventh

Ain't that a bitch
Like life is, 
not your wife is
See that your better half
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold is my self pride
So these streets I strive
Like a Black Panther asking can the
Situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase ""keep it real"" passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals that the Earth hate
Doing they damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing that I'm worth wait
Or at least my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R.E.M
Created in His own image so am I him?
And in the middle of this crisis

Well, he damn sure not in 
K town

wild hundreds

To do a lot of drinking
But now I do a lot of thinking

When you heard I
Was one of the chosen
Industry doors keep closing
Watch the closing doors

But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch like a sissy
Please miss me with all that bullshit you popping

When We Move,"[Verse 1: Common]
Bouncin', mystic, realistic
And simplistic, spirits visit
How we live it, it's intrinsic
Kismet kissed it, it's smeared like lipstick
Colorful on our souls
A mouth full of gold or a drummer's roll
Stories get told about us
That's why things so blah without us
Wherever we are you can feel the prowess
Whenever we move, yo, we turn the style up
I'ma just give Black power its flowers
Whether in the projects or the palace
Even when the pale horse tried to gallop
And stir, stir it up, we kept the balance
We move in silence, we move the loudest
Ancestors in my dreams, they move the wildest
They prayed about us, praised and shouted
Picture this country bein' brave without us
A slave's nostalgia, move through the woods with vigor

Pitch black butterfly from the other side
Somebody's style was lost, it wasn't mine
I'm in a small demographic
Of real ones dealin' with all things classic
King's fabric, linen and silk
From the home of the solid gold honey and milk
The ones who built it from the mud, soil and sand
A Black man, the world in the skin of his hand
Pop, then I stop when I shine beyond stellar
Fela, Kwame Nkrumah, Mandela
Leader, truth-teller, the inkwell dweller
My pen signs a New York Times best-seller
When I move, y'all move in my wake
B-D energy I generate
How to never move weak, I demonstrate
Celebratin' my peeps when I innovate

Death is ageless, life is dangerous
Change is the only thing guaranteed
I ain't afraid of the opps cause I know they bleed just like us
In the Seven Kingdoms ain't nobody righteous
A massacre at the Red Wedding, the lifeless
Laid on the ground, now who wears the crown?
A rope tied around by the power we bound
Sound the trumpets, I got soldiers by the hundreds
We all want it with our eyes on the summit
Chaos is a ladder and some fall from it
Some get tall from it, high like they all blunted
But this the year that we doing it with no fears

Pops is gone, Uncle in prison
Inside wishin' for men to teach me 'bout girls and religion
Made my own rendition of grindin' and kissin'
Weekend calls to my Dad I'd listen
Still I felt distant, distant like love
There's only so far that words could really hug
Didn't wanna be a thug, older niggas I banged with
I learned a lot from them cuts in the basement
The smell of blunts laced with a little bit of spice

Memories of home,"[Verse 2: Common]
Metaphors can't explain how far I came
A young man at work, I made my own lane
Steered away from pain, relied on drive
There's a old saying, ""Don't cry, survive""
As I kept building there were cranes in the sky
Certain memories my brain would deny
A tear laid in my eye, I was afraid to reply
To the hurt that was callin', it came from the sky
An older play cousin, of course I trust him
But he was touchin' where he wasn't supposed to be touchin'
What's a kid supposed to do?
When they goin' through, what I was goin' through
Don't know who to go to
You want to tell somebody
In many ways, I failed somebody
That somebody was me

In the Light Remix (For U),"[Erykah Badu: Common]
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me..
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely
(Chorus)Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family - love ain't simple

Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you

(A Beautiful Revolution) Intro,"[Spoken Word: Jessica Care Moore]
Ain't it beautiful?
When we smile, it's a musical
An act of revolution and the stage is a human one
Some people spend their lives wearing the costume
When the script is Sanskrit in the palms of our worship
The same hands we go to work with
The same hands we go to work with, put the real work in
Meditation and stillness so your focus is the realest
Screaming from the outskirts when your voice is the clearest
Wishing for answers inside of elections
When justice was just born right inside your reflection
Here we stand, survivors of holocausts
Oceans of bodies, bound and lost
Our dreams swam across
Found the will to still live at all costs
The true mastery itself, honoring tears
Loving the mirror beyond your greatest fears
A small army traveling beneath your skin
Walking alone if you need to, the revolution's within
Our bodies birth sons wrapped around Earth's axis
Spinning the way people do when change is necessary action
Our ancestors saw us in the future
Imperfect perfect beams of light
A sacred prophecy of what's possible, be still, and still the night
We are centuries of grace
The internal uprising, the creation of race
The spiritual warfare is the one you can win
An army of angels begin where we end
We beautiful broken, warrior ready in soulhood
The wish and the wish you would
The daughter of drum spangled banners
We are the tearing down, are falling together
Our cosmos, our stars, a subtle peace
Ain't it a miracle to simply feel safe?

Stolen Moments Pt. III,"[Verse: Common]
Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this 
hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bite
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived
In this house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck",Write a verse in the style of Common reflecting on the challenges of living in a city where trust is hard to come by and betrayal is always lurking.

Where Black men and Black women have been

Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here 
with them all
If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it

My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around

Must have came in during the day when at work they was found

A Place in This World,"[Verse 1: Common]
No justice or justification
We trust in God but can't trust in a nation
The cusp of generations searching for a ventilation
If 2020 vision is any indication
Of where we are, where we've been, where do we go?
American ain't legible
My rights are being left behind
In questioned times, they say invest in nines
Tryna rest my mind, the press be pressed to find
Stories by my kind, a suggested crime
Though many, many holler about justicе reform
But won't put dollars where thе hustle is born
You know our politicians, they like to perform
Acting and singing that government song
How they love America when you lovin' it wrong
We the people are becoming reborn

Billie

Black mothers' stomach stay in a knots
We kill each other, more than the cops
I wish the hating would stop
We are at war, in a battle with us
I know that black lives matter, do they matter to us?

As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony? or a misdemeanor?

Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me

What an odyssey

Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far would one let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next

But I wasn't ready to receive it
In fact I made him leave it
Before he could achieve it

And reach the stoplight
Behind me, he flashed lights bright, sorta cop-like

I was taught only to fight in defense or the in will of Allah
And ain't no talking when it's time to spar

Back his lady trying to hold him like big pun
I stowed 'em and told 'em
I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot

You see, Migo
There was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds
We were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd
Of 
Smallfoot
, 
that's right, we used to live down there
But there were actions we could not forgive down there
And though they used a different nomenclature
Man, or human, they showed us human nature
A dangerous species that we approached with wonder
They attacked with their spears and their 
smokin' sticks of thunder
They called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable
They chased us, pursued us, their persistence indomitable
We had no choice but to run and hide
Otherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide
So we climbed this mountain just to stay alive
You see, we knew that up here, Smallfoot cannot survive
So it was here the first law was written in stone
It was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known
Our world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds
That's how it would be
And then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey
For the sake of us all, it was the only way
To protect us from all of the human ravages
Heaped upon us by those human savages(Now you know, now you know, now you know)
(Now you know, now you know) And new rules apply

Intro (Push Out The Noise),"[Intro: Jessica Care Moore]
Push out the noise
Songbirds replace the morning commute
Face adjusting to the lack of sunshine in the blink of an eye
We know exactly where we were when the world stood still and grounded all the stars
On our back porch patios relearning the subtle art of breathing
Our tribes, our well traveled scars
We found warmth inside a family of arms
Connected with other mothers
Crafting countless lives and transforming two-bedroom apartments into theatrical stages
Ceilings covered in constellations
Learning really begins at home now
We remember every lyric to every song ever played
Living room is the dance floor
God bless the DJs
Perhaps the battleground and our peace of mind our suspended on the edge of Earth
Balancing gracefully right outside our front doors
And the laughter of our brilliant boys and the de-silencing of our majestic girls
We (We) push out (Push out) the noise (The Noise)
What is more radical then authentic love?
Moon at half mass, masquerading as global light
I see the God in you, that's what goddesses do
I made you breakfast too, we eat at noon
We move time
Sometimes the bravest step is standing our ground
B-Girl stands defiant along these divided skies
The same hands that built all those churches dipped in gold
Palms open and breakdance pose into prayer position
Also made you dinner and kissed away all your fears
The ones that saw us in the future and prayed us into existence from the 1700's
We still here
Everywhere aliens
Where to win if not in our own mythology?
Where to find comfort if not in the arms of our lover?
Our children swing, our breath pushes them into possibility and whispers their stories into truth
Birth is never planned, but oh, how we first cry
Fly Sankofa style
 back into a safe place along his treasure chest
A few moments right before the sun sets when summer returns after winter wept
Tears become a necessary blessing, a holy water for the forgotten
We are praying to any ancestor listening
Ain't we always been a amplified joy?
A boombox altered for the descendants of drums and water bearers
A gathering of souls
A sanctuary surrounded by natural springs, the bling of butterflies
Headphone escape route, a survivor's anthem plays on
Someone will tell them, ""We are still alive""
We fight inside the music on our own land
Built from ancestral memory and questions
When do warriors rest? When there is nothing left to die for
What have you learned from being inside?
There's still no place like home","Write an intro in the style of Jessica Care Moore that reflects on the power of love, family, and the resilience of generations."

OUTRO (Exclamation Point),"[Interlude: Morgan Parker]
Tell you something about poetry, it refuses
It breaks and asks to be broken
The broken pieces form a question mark
And this is the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
The radical belief that broken is beautiful
That breaking is essential
That revolution is built from wreckage
Exclamation comes from asking
The question is, ""What use do we have for time not measured by the rivers dancing beneath us?
In us? Beforе us?""
We pray like this, majestic, еlectric
We slide, step, dip, shake, every room a dance floor
Let all my skin kin in, let sunshine in
Let me kiss on my loves chosen and fought for
Come, make you a plate
Pour some out
Return and get it
This is the thing about poems
They want to live
They remind us when we forget how to love and be love
How even leaves have veins with stories to tell
And we are the stories
We are the radical and hopeful
We are the revolutionary poem, exclamation point
You don't have to go home, but this is only the start
The good part is what comes next","Write an interlude in the style of Morgan Parker, reflecting on the beauty of brokenness and the revolutionary power of poetry."

A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief

In tangible goods, 
platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders

Lost One,"[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one",Write a verse in the style of Jay-Z reflecting on the dangers of fame and losing oneself in the industry.

I don't think it's meant to
 
be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair,
 
so yeah, she lost one

My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

Used to rock a throwback, ballin' on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit, lookin' like a owner
