Mural,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes
 
wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not “rain” like “Rain Man” or rain like “rain dance”
Or rain like a “slight chance of rain” when it's rainin’
Or “rein” like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But “reign” like queens that reign over made man
And not “Queen” like “Queen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem’” Queen
But “queen” like white-glove-wave-hand
And not “wave hand,” like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking “wave,” like you saying, ""Hey, man!""
And not hay for horses
 or ""hoarsest"" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor,
 but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah","Write a verse exploring the complexities of identity, inspired by Lupe Fiasco's style."
Mural,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh!
 
Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets
 
OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff
, 
ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco exploring the concept of identity and societal expectations.
Bitch Bad,"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey
","Write an intro in the style of Lupe Fiasco, contrasting the stereotypes of women and emphasizing the empowerment of being a lady."
Bitch Bad,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average.""
And maybe other rhyming words like ""cabbage"" and ""savage""
And ""baby carriage"" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health,
 
he may skew respect for dishonor
",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco reflecting on the impact of a mother's self-perception on a young child's understanding of respect and honor.
Bitch Bad,"[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]

Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood",Write a hook in the style of Lupe Fiasco highlighting the complexity and empowerment of women.
Bitch Bad,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches.""
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch
","Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco addressing the influence of popular music on young girls' perception of themselves and the concept of a ""bad bitch."""

Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)",Write a hook in the style of Lupe Fiasco that challenges societal perceptions of women and celebrates their true worth.
Bitch Bad,"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using ""bitch"" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
""Bad"" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But ""bad"" mean bad to him, ""bitch"" don't play a part
But ""bitch"" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!
",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco examining the complexities of perception and language in relationships.
Bitch Bad,"[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good

They misunderstood",Write a hook in the style of Lupe Fiasco challenging societal perceptions of women.
Bitch Bad,"[Outro: MDMA]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood

Lady better, greatest motherhood

Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First off, say ""Peace"" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
, 
suicide bombers
And prosperity gospels,
 
emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils
They got to, just to stay awake
On the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels, and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism, and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash
A friend request, follow, and a hashtag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac","Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco addressing the societal issues of colonialism, consumerism, and cultural appropriation."
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Live from the other side, what you see?
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe

A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way
",Write a chorus in the style of Lupe Fiasco discussing the struggles of finding peace in a chaotic world.
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco that discusses the societal issues of planned obsolescence and the importance of seeking truth over instant gratification.
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]

Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way
",Write a chorus in the style of Lupe Fiasco addressing the struggles of seeking freedom and peace in a world filled with chaos and inequality.
Around My Way (Freedom Ain’t Free),"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central, an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city,
 
Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege, vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the mid-ler
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…",Write a verse in the style of Lupe Fiasco addressing the inequalities and struggles faced in impoverished communities.

Words I Never Said,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]

I can't take back the words I never said
","Write a chorus in the style of Skylar Grey, expressing inner turmoil and regret over unspoken words."
Words I Never Said,"[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist

Words I Never Said,"[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

Words I Never Said,"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees; ""What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too!""
And then it hit me, standing outside of heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid

Superstar,"[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that!""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Superstar)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)","Write a chorus in the style of Lupe Fiasco and Matthew Santos, challenging the listener to prove their superstar status amidst the spotlight and scrutiny."

SLR 2,"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
For real though, like for real though
Like for real
You know what I'm sayin', I don't even
It's like, niggas must forget who the fuck
Did what the fuck
When the fuck
When niggas was still, not the fuck
Or whatever
Fine then, I say
